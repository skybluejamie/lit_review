,103,rayyan-339919063,Making tropical agriculture more Sustainable by using bioeconomic models,2007,1,1,,,,,,"Barbier B., Deybe D., Alary V., Carpentier C.L.",,,,,"Small farmers from the tropics are struggling to sustain their livelihoods while the world's natural and policy environment is changing. Trade liberalization affects many of these farmers differently- often negatively when subsidies and protections are removed, sometimes under the direction of ""structural adjustment"" programs of, for example, the IMF or the World Bank; in some cases positively when previous policies were biased against agriculture and when a freer access to market expands opportunities. Looking beyond short-term profits, the question of whether the new policies induce more sustainable production systems is still quite ambiguous. Small farmers are also struggling to adopt new technologies. There seemingly is a large variety of technologies available, but adoption is still low among small farmers from tropical countries. What type of policies and what type of technologies can help improve productivity of poor farmers while maintaining the resource base? To what degree do these new technologies make small farmers beholden to debt, the industrialized countries, and the probable future increases in the price of petroleum and its products? To answer these questions, one has to study farming systems in some detail and make some predictions about how these systems will respond, change, and adapt to external incentives while population is increasing rapidly even as natural resources are under increasing pressure. Teams of economists and agriculturalists join their expertise to link farming system analysis and natural resources processes with human behavioral models to simulate the dynamics of the farming systems under various scenarios. In this chapter we present a few applications of these bioeconomic models to address the impacts of increasing population pressure, increasing access to markets, and external incentives related to welfare and natural resources management. What are the relations between these factors and environmental degradation? What are the policy and technical options to make these systems more sustainable? In the first part of the chapter, we present the tropical agroecosystems that we studied. In the second, we review the use of bioeconomic models in agriculture. In the third we describe a few applications, and in the last part we present overall results and conclusions. The Tropical Agroecosystems Studied Tropical small-scale farming systems are numerous and diverse but can be categorized according to a gradient of management intensity from slash-andburn to permanent agriculture (Ruthenberg 1980). In this chapter we analyze and compare the fallow systems from the savanna of West Africa, the forest systems of the hillsides of Central America, the rancher system of the humid forest margin of Amazonia in Brazil, and the permanent intensive systems of the subhumid Gangetic Plain of northern India as representative of this gradient of intensification. In West Africa, increasing population pressure on land should lead, at least according to the Boserup school of thought, to labor and capital intensification and to the adoption of new technologies (Boserup 1965; see chapter 12). Instead, we observe migrations either to less-populated rural areas or to overcrowded cities. Trade liberalization of the mid-1990s was supposed to free farmers from an ""inefficient"" state, but while the devaluation of an overvalued currency had a positive impact, privatization led to market failures and too often the destruction of these farmers' way of subsistence. The three African villages studied, located on a north-south transect representing a gradient of increasing rainfall, are typical of their climatic conditions. The Sahelian village of Banizoumbou in Niger (ILRI dataset 1998) was used to predict the future of transhumance in the Sahel (Barbier and Hazell 2000). Increasing population pressure and expansion of cropland makes the traditional transhumance migrations of cattle and sheep from north to south more difficult every year. While most ""experts"" believe that nomadism has no future, a recent school of thought argues that it is the most suitable human activity for the Sahelian ecosystem (Scoones 1996). The other semiarid village, Kolbila on the Mossi Plateau of Burkina Faso (ICRISAT dataset), is less arid but is located in a much more densely populated region. Agriculture is the main activity, but its sustainability is at risk because of declining biomass and soil fertility. The village of Bala, located in the cotton-producing area of Burkina Faso (CIRAD dataset), is in a more humid region. It is less populated at present, but immigration from the north is increasing population pressure, which induces a shift from slash-andburn to a more intensive but not yet sustainable system (Barbier and BenoÎt-Cattin 1997). In Central America, we analyzed the situation of the communities on the hillsides of Honduras. In addition to being the second-poorest country of the American continent after Haiti, Honduras was hit by a hurricane in 1999, which destroyed a large part of its infrastructure and showed as well how poor management of its upper watersheds has made its valleys vulnerable to floods and landslides. Most of the fertile lowland valleys are used for extensive large-scale ranching, while small farmers struggle on the steep hillsides where the topsoil is eroding rapidly. The five Honduran watersheds where we applied bioeconomic models represent contrasting pathways of development. Farmers in the Lalima watershed follow a vegetable production pathway, producing principally a large range of vegetables. Overdrafting of the river by irrigation reduces water availability during the dry season (Barbier and Bergeron 1999). The San Nicolas watershed has become an intensive coffee production and processing area, which generates extremely high levels of water contamination that in turn affect many downstream communities (Barbier et al. 2003). The Río Calán watershed produces vegetables and coffee and supplies water to the downstream city of Siguatapeque and to a large hydroelectric dam (Jimenez et al. 2000). In the Jalapa watershed, farmers produce on steep slopes prone to rapid erosion and are part of the El Cajón watershed, which drains into a dam that generates 60 percent of the electricity used in Honduras (Hernández 2002:642). In the Choluteca watershed, widespread grain production on slopes threatens the sustainability of the shrimp industry downstream in the mangroves of the Golfo de Fonseca (Hernández et al. 2002). The large charge of sediment in the water makes shrimp production much more expensive (Samayoa 2000:647). In these watersheds, the ""pathway of development"" type applied by the population has been explained as principally a function of exogenous factors such as agroclimatic conditions, availability of spring water, and access to markets (Pender et al. 1999). The two watersheds that were well connected to markets have progressively expanded their vegetable production. Those located farther from a good paved road or major city have focused on coffee where rainfall is generous and on basic grain if the climate is drier. In Brazil, the Amazonian forest continues to shrink progressively under pressure from loggers followed by small farmers and finally ranchers. In some areas the Brazilian government is trying to prevent farmers from clearing more forest by allocating plots of a few dozen hectares of forest margin to families, under the condition that they will stay within these boundaries and clear only half of their holdings. One such settlement project takes place on the western southern border of the Amazonian forest (IFPRI dataset) in the regionsof Rondonia. The objective of the study was to identify the second-best alternative to slash-andburn (Carpentier et al. 1999). Is it coffee, timber production, forest products extraction, food crop, cattle ranching, or carbon sequestration? The model was supposed to verify if the new systems are economical and environmentally sustainable. The Indian study is set in Haryana state in northern India, one of the most productive states of India, and also one of the most populated. In the 1960s and 1970s the green revolution, based on improved germ plasm, chemical fertilizers, and irrigation, transformed the state into a massive producer of rice and wheat. The adoption of new techniques was helped by heavy governmental subsidies to reduce input price and stabilize output prices especially for wheat and rice (Aggarwal et al. 2000; Dorin and Landy 2002). Now that the Indian government is trying to cut subsidies to the agricultural sector, some fear that Haryana's grain production will stagnate. Now that the government wants to reduce subsidies for water and electricity, one has to assess the likely impact on production, poverty, and the environment (Alary 2002:645). Overall, the comparative study given in this chapter includes nine farming systems in four ecoregions of five countries (tables 31.1-31.3). All except the Indian example are small-scale, semicommercialized farming systems integrating crop and livestock, using mainly hand tools with little mechanization and irrigation. They are all increasingly integrated to the market, but population pressures and resource degradation are at play. © 2007 by the University of New Mexico Press.

We utilize a discrete choice experiment approach with the consideration of potential heterogeneity.

However, in Canaima National Park and World Heritage Site in southeastern Venezuela, since 1981 managers have employed a costly fire control program to eliminate savanna burning by the Pemon indigenous people. Here I present the results of the first study on Pemon perspectives of fire management in the park. I show that savanna burning is an important tool in indigenous land management and plays a key role in preventing large catastrophic fires. Pemon knowledge of fire also raises questions about conventional interpretations of environmental change in the park. Lastly, I recommend a fire management policy that seeks to integrate local ecological knowledge. This will require: (a) greater openness from scientists and resource managers to understanding Pemon rationale for the use of fire, (b) clarification among the Pemon themselves of their own views of fire, and (c) research partnerships among scientists, resource managers and the Pemon in order to encourage understanding of Pemon ecological knowledge of fire, and to assess its true impact in the Canaima National Park. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2006.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jamie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Venezuela,indigenous,actor focus,burning context",,,

With logging and mining seen as increasing threats to the region, it is necessary to look at methods for engaging stakeholders in monitoring the status of their natural resources. This paper presents the results of a pilot study carried out to investigate water use by the Makushi Amerindians, and collect baseline data on the hydro-morphological aspects of the waterways. Methods included informal interviews, the use of the River Habitat Survey (RHS), and water quality measurements. The results indicate the heavy reliance of the Makushi on the waterways for their daily lives, particularly on fishing. Although ponds and creeks are important sources of fish, the rivers provide much larger catches of a greater diversity of fish species, both in the wet and dry seasons. The physical characteristics of the water sources used by the Makushi are mainly associated with the surrounding habitat types: The savanna areas containing the more nutrient rich white-water rivers, and the tropical forest areas containing the less nutrient rich black-water rivers. This study indicates that at present there is no direct evidence of adverse impacts on the waterways used by the Makushi in terms of fish catches, habitat conditions and water quality. A monitoring scheme was set up using this study's outputs as a baseline from which any future changes can be compared. Further work is to be carried out over the next three years to produce monitoring and sustainable management procedures for the North Rupununi ecosystems, by linking the physical attributes of the environment to biodiversity and subsequently local livelihoods, and by building capacity of local stakeholders through training. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we highlight strong similarities in environmental, institutional, and other contextual conditions among SAM and Southern African (SAFR) dry forest and savanna regions, and compile evidence for an emerging soybean production frontier in SAFR. Knowledge transfer, cooperation, and direct investment between SAM and SAFR countries constitute crucial elements of soybean expansion in Africa. Comparing maps of soybean suitability, biodiversity, and carbon revealed substantial and spatially diverse trade-offs, suggesting that the emerging soybean frontier in SAFR may poses major challenges for conservation. An increased focus of conservation science on agricultural expansion and intensification in SAFR, as well as strong environmental policies for balancing agricultural production and conservation goals, are needed to mitigate potentially large trade-offs.

This shift is driven by the shortage of land suitable for expansion of cultivation and grazing in the temperate zone, increased global demands for agricultural commodities, the rising price of petroleum, and technological advances. At risk are some of the world's most ecologically and culturally-rich landscapes in the world, such as the Amazon rainforest, the Cerrado woodland complex, and African savannas. A strategy for reducing the negative ecological and social impacts of this transition could harness the rising environmental and social standards imposed by many importers and purchasers of agricultural commodities, similar reforms underway among ""Equator"" banks, growing corporate governance, and Brazil's prominence in international diplomacy. Integrated certification of commodity sanitation, compliance with rigorous environmental standards, and sound labor practices could become the norm for participation in commodity markets. These reforms in agro-industrial behavior could be reinforced by trade agreements and strategic support from non-governmental organizations. © 2008 by The Haworth Press.

The Pampas and Chaco regions of Argentina have been global hotspots of agricultural land-use change since the 2000s, yet our understanding of what drives the spatial patterns of these land-use changes remains partial. We parameterized a net returns model of agricultural land-use change to estimate the probability of agricultural expansion (conversions of woodlands to either cropland or grazing land) and agricultural intensification (conversion of grazing land to cropland) at the 1-km scale for the years 2000 and 2010. Uniquely, our model allowed us to quantify the importance of underlying causes (i.e., changes in agricultural profit) and spatial determinants (i.e., soil fertility, distance to markets, etc.), for Argentina's prime agricultural regions as a whole. We found that cropland and grazing land expansion into woodlands was much less sensitive to changes in profit-related factors than agricultural intensification. Profit-related variables, were a particularly strong cause of intensification in the Pampas, where cropland profits rose by 29% (compared to 18% in the Chaco). This suggests that further conversions of grazing land to cropland in the Pampas and Chaco is likely as long as agricultural demand, and thus returns to agriculture, continue to be high. The moderate impact of profit-related factors on affecting woodland conversion rates also suggests a limited potential of economic policies that affect marginal profits (e.g., taxes or subsidies) to alter deforestation rates and patterns in major ways. Policies that target socio-economic variables not included in our profit-focused framework (e.g., capital availability), area-based interventions (e.g., land zoning), or less-profit oriented actors (e.g., via community-based management) might be more effective in addressing deforestation rates in the Chaco. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jamie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: chaco,pampas,argentina",,,argentina

The application of the PROMETHEE multi-criteria method integrates a private cost–benefit analysis that describes the policy effects on farms and a contingent valuation study that describes the valuation of forest ecosystem services by the urban population of that region. The impact of five policy alternatives considering seven sustainability criteria was simulated. Criteria weighting was applied taking into account the preferences of theoretical decision-maker profiles and workshop participants. Our study finds that the most preferred alternatives are extension programs with and without prohibition of deforestation. The multi-criteria decision analysis shows an almost generalized coincidence, both in the simulation of theoretical weightings and in the workshop: The reforestation program with prohibition of deforestation is the best performance alternative, while deregulation is the alternative with the worst performance. Only when considering a free-market profile, deregulation has the best performance. It is concluded that multi-criteria methods facilitate the decision-making process, assessing policy alternatives by means of a wide range of criteria and by enabling different actors to express their preferences. Consequently, it constitutes a useful tool to support public decision making, particularly for policies related to the conservation of dry forests at local and global scales. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jamie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: caldenal,argentina",,,argentina

The purpose of this article is: i) to assess systematically the role of agricultural expansion, intensification and demographics on the loss of natural habitat and ii) to understand how institutional factors contribute to direct the impact of agricultural intensification towards land sparing or Jevons paradox. We use multivariate statistical methods to assess the effect of important institutional changes, including the promulgation of the Forest Law in the Province of Salta and the titling of communal lands to Indigenous Peoples (IPs), on the loss of natural forests, shrublands and grasslands in the Chaco Salteño. Our results show that the approval of the Forest Law in Salta has been ineffective at slowing down the loss of natural habitat and is associated with the emergence of Jevons paradox via the increase in agricultural productivity. Moreover, this new institutional context appears to have increased the pressures on IPs land and encouraged preventive clearing on these lands. Finally, we detect the decreasing importance of livestock heads as drivers of natural habitat loss. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jamie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: chaco,argentina",,,argentina

For the Dry Chaco in South America, one of the largest remaining dry forests of the world, we describe the geographical distribution, type of production systems, environmental and social context and output of charcoal based on remote sensing (charcoal kiln detection); together with existing environmental (forest cover/biomass), social (population density, poverty), and infrastructure (roads) data. While most of the region has low kiln densities (&lt;1 kiln every 1000km2), foci of higher production were found in the north of Santiago del Estero and the west of Chaco provinces (&gt;1 kiln every 5km2). Individual or small groups (up to three units) prevail over the regions (58.2% of all kiln sites), frequently associated with a forest land cover. Large groups of kilns (≥12 units, 15.5% of all kilns) were associated with land cleared for cultivation. For a subset of kiln sites for which forest biomass data was available, we found that typical kiln sites (1-3 kilns) had half of the average biomass of the region within a radius of 125m. Although charcoal production in the whole region has been stable for 50years, a strong redistribution from richer to poorer provinces has taken place. At the county level, kiln density and charcoal production records showed a linear association that suggests an average output of 11 tons of charcoal per year per kiln. Comparing counties with high vs. low charcoal production with similarly high forest cover, the first had higher population density and poverty levels. Today small scale charcoal production by poor rural people represents the only significant use of forests products that provides some market incentive for their preservation. However this situation is associated with marginal social conditions, inefficient production, and forest degradation. Developing charcoal production under environmentally and socially virtuous conditions should be seen as a unique opportunity and an urgent challenge in the face of the fast deforestation of dry forests. © 2015 International Energy Initiative.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jamie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: chaco,argentina",,,argentina

By involving stakeholders, whose actions are decisive in dealing with the problem under analysis, we assessed the interactions among processes of multiple dimensions and spatial scales, currently controlling communal forest degradation in 11 peasant communities of Taboada, Ibarra and Salavina departments, in Santiago del Estero province, Argentina. Then, by reconstructing historical processes undergone by these communities over the last century, we analyzed how different system settings have conducted to the system collapse (forests and community loss) or strengthened its adaptive capacity facing natural disturbances (droughts) and anthropogenic stressors (economic shocks, land disputes). This work unveils system attributes related to native resource management and economic diversification on the farm, family and community structure, and social networking with peasant organizations and other institutions, crucial for building social–ecological resilience. Alternative trajectories are shown towards degradation (throughout a downward spiral, often followed by peasant exodus and deforestation) or restoration.

Jaguars (Panthera onca) and pumas (Puma concolor) coexist with livestock in much of their range and have been historically blamed for livestock predation. At present, livestock landscapes are increasing, enlarging the conflict scenario where local perceptions are vital to understand the context in which the conflict emerges and data of livestock predation become an effective tool to plunge into it. We assess local perceptions about felids and identify the bases of the conflict in the Bolivian Pantanal and dry forest ecoregions using livestock predation data. We interviewed local ranchers and crossed information with the governmental livestock database achieving a comprehensive study on the conflict, based on descriptive statistics for local perceptions and generalized linear mixed models for analyzing cattle predation by felids. The conflict appeared to be widespread since most ranchers suffered predation on cattle, especially in the Pantanal. Annual cattle loss is generally low (1.8%) with some exceptions that may magnify the generalized negative perception towards felids. Factors related to cattle management practices explained better felid predation on livestock rather than habitat quality of the ranch or ranchers’ attitude towards felids. We recommend local administrations to recover livestock predation data and to highlight the importance that husbandry practices may have to reduce cattle losses by felids. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jamie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: bolivia,ranching context",,,bolivia

This paper assesses the potential impacts of bioenergy production from local varieties of castor oil plant and jatropha that could reduce the import of energy in the region, while developing its economy. Biodiesel systems based on these crops can be suitable for the Northeast region as they have low water needs, and are either indigenous or have shown excellent adaptation to the local climate. Apart from biodiesel production, the residue from their processing can be a valuable resource usable for biogas production and bio-fertilizers. Using the ecosystem services approach, five land management alternatives are compared: (i) Caatinga woodland (a type of dry savannah native to the region), (ii) a scheme of local jatropha varieties and vegetation for Caatinga forest restoration, (iii) a crop rotation scheme of castor oil plant and cowpeas, (iv) cowpea mono-cropping, and (v) pasture. Based on the analysis of secondary data, some provisioning and regulating services were assessed quantitatively, while others qualitatively. The results suggest that the conversion of (i) cowpea mono-cropping to a rotation of cowpeas and castor and (ii) degraded pastures to a jatropha-Caatinga forest restoration scheme can provide a bundle of provisioning, regulating and supporting ecosystem services. Feedstock for bioenergy is the most important ecosystem service derived from these multi-functional landscapes. In particular converting pasture to a jatropha-Caatinga forest restoration scheme could provide per hectare 0.7 t of oilseeds for biodiesel production and 1.8 GJ of usable energy, in the form of biogas from the residual seedcake. The castor-cowpea rotation scheme could provide per hectare 1.5 t of oilseeds for biodiesel production together with 2.2 GJ of usable biogas energy, per hectare. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jamie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: brazil,caatinga,socioeconomic",,,brazil

To meet the growing demand for animal products, silvopastoral systems (SPS) can be an alternative as they have greater biodiversity and offer more environmental services than conventional cattle ranching systems. This paper aims to describe the implementation of SPS by traditional farmers in a rural settlement in southeastern Brazil, and the impacts on biodiversity of native plants. SPS were implemented by farmers in three selected areas that were cleared with a tractor. The impacts on the community and populations of native plants were estimated through vegetation sampling before and after the implementation of the SPS. Direct observations and semi-structured interviews were conducted to describe the implementation of the system and to understand the criteria employed to spare species, to manage native plants and the advantages of these systems according to farmers’ perceptions. Before the implementation, 1038 trees from 50 species and 29 botanical families were surveyed in the three areas. The tractor cleared on average 72 % of the trees, decreasing the number of trees ha−1 from 692 to 180 and reducing tree richness in 43 %. On average, 89 % of the removed trees had diameter ranging from 5 to 10 cm, indicating farmers’ preference in sparing the thickest trees. Farmers also spare useful species that have socio-economic importance, such as timber, fruit trees, fodder and medicine.

The combined effect of multiple disturbances can shift forests towards a new, resilient state that is qualitatively distinct in structure, species composition and function. We found that abandoned pastures affected by fires in the Brazilian Atlantic forest showed similarity in terms of vegetation structure and plant functional traits to a savanna-like ecosystem. Burned communities exhibited more C4 grass cover, higher proportion of resprouts and lower canopy cover as compared to the old-growth forest. Moreover, 79% of woody species at the burned sites are generalists with a widespread distribution, which includes the cerrado (Brazilian savanna). Woody species composition was strikingly different from old-growth forests, since burned sites were dominated by Moquiniastrum polymorphum (Less.) G. Sancho (Asteraceae), a fire-resistant species with a ruderal behavior that was absent in the old-growth forests. The results observed in this study provide biological evidence for an arrested succession with the establishment of a savanna-like ecosystem as an alternative stable state. These findings reinforce the notion that the establishment of an alternative stable state (e.g., savanna-like state) hypothesis for the Brazilian Atlantic Forest should be considered, especially under the current climate change scenarios. © 2019 Associação Brasileira de Ciência Ecológica e Conservação","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jamie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: brazil,abandonment,land use pathways",,,brazil

In a world scale savannahs are one of the most important land extensions with agricultural potential for crop and forestry production. These territories also constitute the main alternative to agricultural expansion into ecologically fragile tropical areas such as tropical rainforests and hillsides. Forty years ago anthropic activity had little effect on Latin American savannahs, since they were used for extensive cattle raising. In the last four decades, however, the natural herbaceous vegetation with low nutrient requirements in the savannahs (llanos) of Colombia and Venezuela, as well as in the Cerrado (Brazil) has been replaced by introduced African pastures, particularly from the genera Brachiaria and Andropogon. Furthermore, intensive reforestation programs for timber and pulpwood commercialization have introduced species able to cope with the environmental conditions, such as Pinus and Eucaliptus. The introduction of African pastures and annual and perennial crops has been possible with fertilization (N, P, K and lime). The landscape modifications caused by these land uses are usually far from the urban areas and are still considered to be low. However, if the entire land surface currently affected by agriculture and agroforestry use and the land yet to be incorporated into projects is taken into consideration, a profound modification is expected to occur in these biomes. Herein is presented a preliminary comparative review of the agricultural colonization processes in the Llanos and Cerrados.

These changes have effects on vegetation structure and recovery, species composition, and ecosystem function. Understanding how human management can affect fire regimes is vital to detect potential changes in the resilience of plant communities, and to predict vegetation responses to human interventions. We evaluated the fire regimes of two recently protected areas in Madagascar (Ibity and Itremo NPA) and one in Brazil (Serra do Cipó NP) before and after livestock exclusion and fire suppression policies. We compare the pre- and post-management fire history in these areas and analyze differences in terms of total annual burned area, density of ignitions, burn scar size distribution, fire return period and seasonal fire distribution. More than 90% of total park areas were burned at least once during the studied period, for all parks. We observed a significant reduction in the number of ignitions for Ibity NPA and Serra do Cipó NP after livestock exclusion and active fire suppression, but no significant change in total burned area for each protected area. We also observed a seasonal shift in burning, with fires happening later in the fire season (October–November) after management intervention. However, the protected areas in Madagascar had shorter fire return intervals (3.23 and 1.82 years) than those in Brazil (7.91 years). Our results demonstrate that fire exclusion is unattainable, and probably unwarranted in tropical grassland conservation areas, but show how human intervention in fire and vegetation patterns can alter various aspects of the fire regimes.

Natural lightning fires can easily happen in savannas and grasslands, but they are rare in the moist rainforests. Today, anthropogenic fires are frequent in both the fire-adapted cerrado (Brazilian savanna) and the fire-sensitive rainforest. In this paper, I compare two very different biomes concerning their susceptibilities and responses to fire: the Amazon rainforest and the cerrado. I present an overview of their fire history, especially regarding human-made fires for land management, and pull together information about the use of fire by indigenous peoples in the cerrado and the Amazon, as this information is very fragmented. Accordingly, I describe how fire regimes have changed in these biomes over time due to agricultural practices and the consequences of the current altered fire regimes. After European settlement, fire frequency greatly increased in the cerrado, especially related to cattle ranching, and more recently in the more seasonal landscapes in the Amazon. In cerrado natural preserves, however, managers try to keep fire away, but wildfires eventually come and develop into destructive events. Actions to reduce biodiversity loss and environmental deterioration due to inappropriate fire management are necessary and should be very distinct in both areas: in the Amazon they would include the development of policies to stimulate fire-free, small-scale agricultural projects, and in the cerrado, sustainable use of fire for cattle ranching is possible but the regimes must be fitted to local specific features in order to avoid land degradation. In cerrado conservation areas, proper fire management programs based on scientific knowledge and the incorporation of the traditional expertise of indigenous peoples are needed to maintain the biological diversity, to maintain the ecological processes, and to reduce wildfires.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jamie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: brazil,cerrado",,,brazil

In the ∼2 million km 2 Brazilian cerrado biome, a global biodiversity hotspot, vast areas have been converted into croplands and cattle pastures. Because the cerrado biome is overwhelmingly contained within private lands, Brazil's environmental legislation should serve as a decisive instrument in protecting these natural ecosystems. We assessed the role of Legal Reserves (LRs), legally defined as the minimum proportion of private landholdings set aside to protect natural vegetation, in the conservation of the cerrado biome. We assume that the property-scale allocation of LRs is primarily based on economic decision-making, creating a bias against cerrado protection. We therefore assessed the area ratio between forest vegetation (FV) and grassland vegetation (GV) areas across LRs within 48,762 landholdings, 9 formal protected areas (PAs) and 34 Indigenous Lands (ILs) within the cerrado (sensu lato) of the 903,357-km 2 state of Mato Grosso, Brazil. We show that there are 7.26 ha of forest lands for each hectare of native grasslands within private RLs of the cerrado biome within Mato Grosso, a ratio almost three-fold larger than that found in formal PAs and ILs. ILs protect in absolute values (hectares) six-fold more native grassland vegetation than PAs. We discuss the policy relevance of this severe land-use bias in maintaining the heterogeneity of cerrado habitats for biodiversity conservation within private properties, which account for 90% of the entire cerrado biome. © 2018 Associação Brasileira de Ciência Ecológica e Conservação","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jamie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: brazil,policy,cerrado,political ecology",,,brazil

These savannas are important providers of ecosystem services that, if intact, could represent around US$ 1.52 billion annually. We hold that the ZSC should be reformulated, with fair participation of stakeholders, in accordance with Brazil’s legal requirements.

The present study aimed to quantify deforestation, forest recovery and net cover change in tropical dry forests (TDFs) in Brazil from 2007 to 2016, and investigate how they are associated to biophysical and socioeconomic factors. We also assessed the effects of LCC variables in human welfare indicators. For this purpose, we used MODIS imagery to calculate TDF gross loss (deforestation), gross gain (forest recovery) and net cover change (the balance between deforestation and forest recovery) for 294 counties in three Brazilian states (Minas Gerais, Bahia, and Piauí). We obtained seven factors potentially associated to LCC at the county level: total county area, road density, humidity index, slope, elevation, and % change in human population and in cattle density. From 2007 to 2016, TDF cover increased from 76,693 to 80,964 km2 (+5.6%). This positive net change resulted from a remarkable forest recovery of 19,018 km2 (24.8%), offsetting a large deforested area (14,748 km2; 19.2%). Practically all these cover changes were a consequence of transitions from TDF to pastures and vice-versa, highlighting the importance of developing sustainable policies for cattle raising in TDF regions. Each LCC variable was associated to different set of factors, but two biophysical variables were significantly associated both to TDF area gained and lost per county: county area (positively) and slope (negatively), indicating that large and flat counties have very dynamic LCCs. The TDF net area change was only associated (negatively) to the humidity index, reflecting an increase in TDF cover in more arid counties. The net increase in Brazilian TDF area is likely a result from an interplay of biophysical and socioeconomic factors that reduced deforestation and caused pasture abandonment. Although the ecological integrity and permanence of secondary TDFs need further investigation, the recovery of this semi-arid ecosystem must be valued and accounted for in the national forest restoration programs, as it would significantly help achieving the goals established in the Bonn agreement and the Atlantic Rain Forest pact. © Copyright © 2020 Espírito-Santo, Rocha, Leite, Silva, Silva and Sanchez-Azofeifa.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jamie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: brazil,context,minas gerais,socioeconomic",,,brazil

A 12-year cash flow was built with both experimental data and estimates for three IFS in the Savannah region: ICL (crops + cattle); ICLF1 (ICL + 227 eucalyptus trees/ha); and ICLF2 (ICL + 357 eucalyptus trees/ha). Investment analysis showed all IFS were viable, but ICL was more profitable than ICLF, due to occasional high crops and beef prices and low wood prices in 2016. In extreme scenarios, i.e. all commodities prices were high (SCE I) or all low (SCE II), results remained the same. However, an alternative, most likely, scenario (SCE III) showed ICLF were more economically recommended than ICL, as beef and crop prices dropped and wood prices increased, which is expected because of commodities price volatility. Thus, the introduction of forestry in future IFS is economically viable, although market risks remain. Further adoption of IFS with trees relies on innovative and follower farmers, with strong support of R&D, technology transfer programmes and IFS policies. © 2014 International Farm Management Association and Institute of Agricultural Management.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jamie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: brazil",,,brazil

However, our understanding of how natural resource use affects natural ecosystems is insufficient. The Caatinga is the most populated dry forest worldwide, and inhabitants depend largely on the exploitation of the natural ecosystem for several purposes such as fuelwood and raising livestock. These constitute 'chronic anthropogenic disturbances' (CAD), the impacts of which, in the long run, may compete with habitat loss and impacts on ecosystem health. In this chapter I present a theoretical framework for the assessment of the impacts of three main sources of CAD on the Caatinga. I discuss how (1) firewood harvesting, (2) raising of free ranging goats, and (3) biological invasion are all linked to changes observed in the Caatinga biota. These sources of CAD are all linked to the socio-economic condition of human populations inhabiting the Caatinga and can be understood and, to some extent, quantified through socio-economic assessments. Finally, I propose a theoretical framework on how the original features of the Caatinga ecosystem may change as a function of the intensity of CAD, leading to two alternative states of both conserved and altered similarity to the original ecosystem. Understanding natural resource use by human populations is crucial to being able to assess the threats to biodiversity and ecosystem functions properly as well as to design conservation strategies to avoid both ecosystem degradation and depletion of human livelihoods. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jamie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: brazil,caatinga,farming context",,,brazil

Although the effects of deforestation are well known, the understanding of its drives at regional levels is incipient. Most studies consider that a driver influences deforestation likewise in all regions. However, deforestation has a strong spatial structure that can lead drivers to vary their influence on deforestation in different regions. Here, we evaluated the spatial variability in the relationship between the recent Cerrado deforestation and socioeconomic, environmental, and structural drivers at a regional scale. We used a geographically weighted regression (GWR) to assess the spatial variability of predictor variables. We identified regions that respond similarly to the drivers by grouping municipalities, considering their GWR coefficients through hierarchical clustering. The analyses that consider the spatial variability of predictors are more appropriated to assess the causes of recent deforestation. Remnant natural vegetation influenced the recent deforestation in all defined regions. Greater access to rural credit concession was the main driving force of deforestation in the northeast region defined here. Distance to roads increased deforestation in the northeast and north regions, while it inhibited deforestation in the central-east and southeast regions. Rainfall inhibited deforestation in the northeast, north, and southwest regions. Steep slope prevented deforestation mainly in the northeast, north, and southwest regions.

The 'environmental stratification' approach, based essentially on pedological, geomorphological and vegetational studies was used, providing a rapid assessment of the ecogeography, its long-term possibilities and constraints. The integrated land use assessment of the stratified units was discussed. Among the four units, three main units occur on the extensive plain surface, forming a climatic gradient. The Caracarai-Anaua unit is dominated by forest and campina vegetation, associated with latosols and hydromorphic podzols. The Lavrado unit is dominated by open grass savanna, with fire-resistant species and gallery forest featuring Buriti palms, resembling a 'dambo'-like landscape. In most cases, the boundaries between these two units are abrupt forest/savanna contacts. The Surumu unit is characterized by xerophytic savanna with cactus, with semiarid species and sodic soils occurring on volcanic-acid rocks. Overall, the present tendency is for an invasion of forest vegetation into savanna areas. The process is directly related to the evolution of the 'veredas de buritis' ecosystem and the capture of closed lakes and 'dambo'-like swamps as 'veredas de buritis' extend and landscape rejuvenation occurs. The main agronomic constraint is the very low nutrient status of the soils, allied to the high aluminum saturation in the Caracarai-Anaua and Lavrado units, and the high sodium content, erosion hazard and stony soils in the Surumu unit. The carrying capacity and the resilience against changes of the units are generally very low. In spite of that, the overall extent of land colonization in Roraima increased by about 70% from 1980 to 1985, although small settlements increased by a disproportionate 242% over that period, mainly as a result of colonization in the forested Caracarai-Anaua unit; in contrast, there was an absolute reduction of 23% in the number of very large settlements. The official land colonization policy was discussed, illustrating the human scenario in NE Roraima. The absence of strategies for rural development is evident, and the current pattern of high mobility of these 'colonos' (settlers) associated with seasonal burning and gold-mining are direct consequences of this illconceived policy. The discredited strategy of cattle ranching is dominant, but no long-term regional planning for development exists. The pattern of human occupation in NE Roraima accords with the pattern of land use in other parts of Amazonia, and highlights the difficulties facing policies seeking to intensify the use of forest land and to achieve effective land colonization.

It is likely that, given these considerable social and ecological constraints, the development model pursued in Roraima today will not provide an economic solution for sustaining the livelihood of most of its inhabitants, perpetuating the present social inequality in any foreseeable scenario.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jamie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: brazil",,,brazil

These landscape transformations have global drivers, but they are often justified by a dominant rationale that they bring development to otherwise underprivileged regions. Such development claims, however, are either taken at face value or conflated with simplistic macroeconomic indicators that gloss over most social issues. Those claims may, therefore, hide severe inequities. To better analyze these phenomena, we revisit and conceptualize the notion of maldevelopment, here defined as inequitable and exclusive processes of change that deprive most local stakeholders of their social and material capabilities. Using an inclusiveness framework, we then conduct an in-depth analysis of soy expansion in the Matopiba region of Brazil's Cerrado. This rich biome with a mosaic of land uses forms an agriculture-savanna landscape that is rapidly giving way to soy monoculture – under the guise of development. Through fieldwork and primary data collection in 18 Matopiba municipalities, we have interviewed 62 stakeholders in that landscape transformation from different social groups. We assess how soy expansion has altered access and allocation patterns of key resources such as land and water, as well as participation in the local food systems and governance initiatives. When looking beyond general economic indicators, our findings expose a brutally exclusive process of environmental degradation and resource dispossession. Yet the stakeholders we interviewed do not want to simply be left undisturbed but to experience inclusive development instead, with participation in governance and support for bottom-up initiatives. We conclude that the frequently cited claim that industrial monocultures bring development to underserved regions deserves far greater scrutiny, and that inclusiveness in the design and execution of interventions is crucial for avoiding maldevelopment. © 2020 The Author(s)","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jamie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: brazil,cerrado",,,brazil

Local pastoral management creates seasonal mosaic patterns of burnings performed for productive activities and for deliberate landscape management, i.e. to protect fire-sensitive vegetation and avoid wildfires. Whereas government-managed areas were affected by large biennial late dry season wildfires, community-managed areas with a regular fire regime suffered less damage.

The savanna biome is responsible for 86% of all fire events, contributes to 10% of the total carbon emissions annually and is home to 10% of the human population. European colonization has been associated with the implementation of fire suppression policies in many tropical savanna regions, markedly disrupting traditional fire management practices and transforming ecosystems. In this paper we assess savanna burning approaches from pre-colonial to contemporary eras in three regions: northern Australia, southern Africa and Brazil. In these regions, fire suppression policies have led to (i) conflicts between government authorities and local communities; (ii) frequent late dry season wildfires and/or (iii) woody encroachment. Such consequences are facilitating changes to fire management policies, including recognition and incorporation of traditional ecological knowledge in contemporary community-based adaptive savanna fire management. Such programs include implementation of prescribed early dry season fires and, in some regions, generating income opportunities for rural and traditional communities through the reduction of late dry season wildfires and associated greenhouse gas emissions. We present a brief history of fire management policies in these three important savanna regions, and identify ongoing challenges for implementation of culturally and ecologically sustainable fire management policies. © 2018","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jamie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: brazil,context,Australia,South Africa",,,brazil

In protected areas in the Brazilian savannas (Cerrado), the predominant management policy is fire suppression, reflecting a cultural heritage which considers that fire always has a negative impact on biodiversity. Here we compare resultant fire-regimes in Canastra National Park (CNP), southeast Brazil, associated with areas under and without fire suppression management, based on a 16-year Landsat imagery record. In open grasslands of the Canastra plateau (CP), firefighting is undertaken under government-sanctioned regulation, whereas in the Babilonia sector, non-sanctioned fire management is undertaken by small farmers to promote cattle grazing and cropping. Fire regimes in the Canastra sector are characterized by few, very large, late dry season wildfires recurring at intervals of two years. Fire regimes in lowlands of the Babilonia sector are characterized by many small-scale, starting at the beginning of the dry season (EDS). In Babilonia uplands fire regimes are characterized by higher frequencies of large fires. The study illustrates major challenges for managing fire-prone areas in conflict-of-interest regions. We suggest that management planning in CNP needs to effectively address: i) managing conflicts between CNP managers and local communities; and ii) fire management practices in order to achieve more ecologically sustainable fire regimes.

The wetlands occupy topographic depressions on the flat plateau, which are permanently or seasonally waterlogged, with topsoil that has high contents of organic matter and endemic fauna and flora. These systems are important for regulating the water flux in the riverine network. Despite their environmental importance, the wetlands are largely neglected in planning policy, environmental legislation and scientific research, resulting in their degradation by the expansion and intensification of agriculture. In the studied catchment, a typical tropical savannah landscape and a region of typical agribusiness land use in the state of Minas Gerais was considered, where the Vereda and Murundu ecosystems are completely surrounded by agriculture. The transition zone between dry and wet soils is the most fragile and susceptible to degradation because it is subjected to the continuous expansion of land tillage. If the agribusiness model deployed in the region is responsible for the increase in wetland destruction, then changes in regulatory laws to define and preserve permanent preservation areas in the Brazilian Forest Code, for the years 1934, 1965, 1989 and in the two versions from 2012, are an impediment to the effectiveness of forest and wetlands protection and the policy of sustainable development. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jamie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: brazil,cerrado",,,brazil

From an environmental point of view, eucalyptus monocultures fragment the areas hitherto preserved of the Cerrado (savannah) biome, leading to loss of connectivity and hampering reproduction of plants and animals. The removal of native vegetation reduces the reproductive capacity of fauna, which in turn, interferes with the resilience capacity of savannah vegetation areas still preserved. In socio-economic terms, the afforestation contributes to the concentration of income and boosts the rural exodus and uncontrolled urbanization process. While afforestation projects can be seen, individually, as economically viable activities, systemically they can result in significant externalities, especially when conducted on large scale, with environmental and social losses that sooner or later will lead to economic unsustainability.

Although species’ protection – notably of large carnivores – can have negative consequences for economic interests and human well-being, environmental justice issues related to species conservation are rarely explored. In Brazil, jaguars (Panthera onca) have become flagships for a series of conservation initiatives. Whereas jaguars’ direct impact on cattle farming has been studied, their influence on other rural stakeholders is poorly understood. Here we study local people's views on jaguars and jaguar conservation across the Cerrado savannah and the Amazon rainforest biomes. Using Q-methodology, we identified five distinct narratives regarding jaguar conservation in relation to environmental justice issues. These were shared among fishermen, tourist guides, cattle breeders, crop farmers and jaguar hunters. Interestingly, we did not find any systematic differences in subjective views, across regions, or professions/livelihood forms. However, our results showed a strong desire among the stakeholders for more local empowerment to influence the management of both jaguars and nature where they live.

The Llanos have traditionally supported extensive beef cattle production systems but are increasingly in demand for food, feed and oil production. The establishment of improved tropical pastures is a continuing trend as a means of intensifying beef production. Published data and the authors' own on-farm databases were collated and analyzed to estimate commercial cattle weight gains. A total of 198 records representing pastures directly drilled into native savanna and pastures undersown with rain-fed upland rice and maize were available for the 1979-2016 period, and were compared with savanna-based beef production. Records were available for sown paddocks 1-15 years in age that were managed solely by ranchers or by consensus between ranchers and researchers. Performance was not affected by who made the management decisions. Pastures sown in association with maize largely out-yielded all others, but observations on these paddocks were restricted to only 3 years and there was a steep fall in production with age. Differences between conventionally established and riceassociated pastures decreased rapidly over time, and production from these pastures did not differ over the longer term. Pasture age and stocking rate during the rainy season were the major factors influencing output from all systems. Overall, adjusted, long-term weight gains per year ranged between 11 and 386 kg/ha for savanna and maize undersown pastures. The data suggest a need to document long-term planned, regular, crop-pasture rotations, but none was available. The analyses provide valuable, long-term estimates of realized beef production under commercial conditions that should assist in decision-making by graziers and policy makers. © 2019.Los Llanos Orientales de Colombia se caracterizan por sabanas tropicales formadas sobre suelos ácidos, pobres en nutrientes, pero constituyen un recurso de tierras muy importante para el país.

El reemplazo de las pasturas nativas de baja calidad por pasturas mejoradas es un proceso continuo para intensificar la producción ganadera. Se compilaron datos publicados, así como las bases de datos de los autores, para estimar las ganancias de peso vivo a nivel de fincas. Se dispuso de 198 registros que incluían potreros de sabana y de pasturas que se sembraron directamente o en asociación con maíz o arroz de secano. Los registros incluyeron casos de 1 a 15 años de duración. No se encontraron diferencias según las decisiones de manejo tomadas por el productor, o como resultado de discusión con investigadores. Pasturas establecidas bajo maíz superaron largamente la producción de las demás, pero los datos se refieren solo a tres años de registro y mostraron una caída pronunciada con la edad. Las diferencias iniciales entre pasturas convencionales y las establecidas con arroz desaparecieron en el largo plazo. Las ganancias anuales de peso a largo plazo y ajustadas estadísticamente variaron entre 11 y 386 kg por hectárea para sabana y el sistema maíz-pasto. La edad de las pasturas y la carga animal durante la estación lluviosa fueron los factores más importantes en determinar la producción de peso vivo. Se sugiere la necesidad de documentar la producción a largo plazo con base en rotaciones regulares y planeadas entre cultivos y pastos.

This article explores this reconstruction by identifying and analyzing historic drivers of landscape change for seven periods between 1500 and 2000, and presents historical land use maps showing major trends and impacts on natural ecosystems. Historic land use maps were built using an ecosystem map of 1998 and a ""preclearing"" ecosystem map, by constraining the spatial change of transformed areas using data on accessibility to rivers and roads, elevation, slope, moisture availability, and settlement areas. We estimate the transformed area rose from approximately 15 Mha in 1500 to 42 Mha in 2000, and land use changed from cropping in 1500 to predominantly grazing in 2000. Demographic impacts of colonization and the introduction of cattle were major drivers of change, but rates and trends of land cover change varied between regions and from period to period. The most impacted ecosystems have been the Andean and tropical dry forests, with the most recent trends toward clearing of humid lowland forests, especially in the Amazon and Pacific. Some landscapes have been subject to strong human influence continuously for more than 500 years, whereas others have been transformed for less than thirty years.

M W.S., Härtl F.H., Paul C., Knoke T.",,,,,"Diversified agricultural landscapes have been shown to provide a wide range of ecosystem services. It is often stated that the main motivation behind growing multiple crops within a farm is to buffer farm income against market and climate risks. However, household characteristics, particularly the amount of off-farm income may also influence farm diversity. While the drivers of diversifying farm income have been investigated extensively, the ecologically important level of land-use diversity on a farm has seldom been used as a dependent variable. Based on data from 163 households, this paper analyzes the impact of social, economic and demographic household characteristics on crop diversification for farms located around the Laipuna Reserve in the dry forests of southern Ecuador. Using a Heckman two-step regression model, we identified factors that influence a) the probability that a farm will be diversified (PD) and b) the degree of diversification at the farm level (LUD), quantified by the Shannon index. We found that PD is positively related to the percentage of household members who depend on family income but do not work (economic dependence ratio), as well as river access and available family labor force. PD is inversely related to access to financial support (i.e. social payments and credits) and off-farm income. LUD is positively related to the number of household members and the age of the head of the household, and correlates negatively with labor force, financial support and off-farm income. Our results demonstrate that land-use diversification is not only a strategy to reduce risk, but it is also driven by farmers’ efforts to meet household, mainly subsistence, needs. Moreover, we also demonstrate that when households have access to financial support and off-farm income, the pressure to diversify their crops diminishes. Finally, we argue that forest and agricultural policies should impose instruments to support land-use diversification financially, while acknowledging the importance of financial support and off-farm income for household economies. Strategies to reduce poverty should be accompanied by direct support of land-use diversification, infrastructure development and agricultural training. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jamie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: ecuador,croplands,socioeconomic",,,ecuador

Populations here have increased exponentially through immigration supplying labour to urban coastal development, and demonstrably unsustainable agro-industrial expansion for export markets. Society has become dislocated from local traditions of environmental and resource management whilst still retaining a wealth of Andean agricultural expertise. Indigenous communities still hold on to vestiges of traditional knowledge. Relicts of natural vegetation, traditional agriculture and agrobiodiversity continue to sustain ecosystem services. Moreover, offer livelihood options and resources for restoration. These aspects reflect a long cultural trajectory, including famous extinct cultures such as Nasca, that evolved within an ever-changing riparian and agricultural landscape influenced by external forces and which incorporated important processes of plant domestication and adaptation to climatic oscillation. Here, we present an ecosystem approach to vegetation restoration and sustainable resource management in Ica, Peru, based on wide interdisciplinary biodiversity inventory and study, where school, community and agro-industry engagement is seen as a prerequisite for success. The approach demonstrated significant plant establishment in this hyperarid region using appropriate low-technology techniques of planting and irrigation with minimum watering. Restoration of a highly degraded environment built upon vegetation relicts followed a strategy of cultural capacity building and environmental engagement, including the development of sustainable forest products, festivals, schools programmes, didactic publications for local use, and collaboration with local communities, landowners, agribusiness and governmental authorities.

International certifications in tropical fruits such as GlobalGAP, Rainforest Alliance, organic or fair-trade, have various limitations: (1) they acknowledge these emerging issues only partially; (2) the standards are uniform and do not take into account the heterogeneity of contexts and of opportunities to build up more sustainable supply chains; (3) these certifications are focused on the farm, the product or the producer organization, but not on the territory, the watershed, the agro-ecosystem and the wider context of local and regional institutional settings. To address these limitations, Agrofair and the TASTE Foundation conducted in-depth case studies of organic and fair-trade certified production systems, in their territorial settings in Peru and Ecuador. North Peru is an arid zone which heavily depends on irrigation, with smallholders who cultivate banana plots of 1 ha in monoculture systems. In South Ecuador, a semi-humid zone was studied, with medium sized producers (5-10 ha) and agroforestry systems (cocoa-forest-banana) in the hillsides. In a second dimension of the study, a rapid survey among five supermarkets in The Netherlands and Belgium and one procurement organization was carried out, to assess the feasibility to introduce a banana with a kind of denomination of origin: mountain-grown banana (Ecuador) or savannah-grown banana (Peru). Could these denominations be carriers of specific sustainability messages (on top of the organic and fair-trade labels)? The survey learned that the retail sector is not looking for complex messages or specific branding: these bananas may have their origin in very different regions, but are all genetically identical Cavendish bananas. However, there are signs that supermarkets are receptive for a more comprehensive approach to a more sustainable banana. This would open new action perspectives for a territorial approach and promotion of a banana with added environmental value.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jamie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: peru,ecuador,farming context",,,peru
