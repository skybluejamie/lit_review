rayyan-335335934,Late History of Tropical Dry Forests in Colombia: 45 Years of Anthropic Transformation,2021,1,1,,,,,,"González-M. R., Pizano C.",,,,,"Tropical dry forests (TDF) are widely distributed in the Neotropics, where they have been shaped by human settlements for centuries. In Colombia, located at the northern portion of South America, only 8% of TDF remain as forest fragments in three regions: the Caribbean in the North, the Inter Andean Valleys at the center of the country, and the Orinoquia in the East. In this work, we used the human footprint index (HFI) to study how human impacts on TDF have changed during the last five decades (1970-2015), and collected field information to assess if, and how, the impact of human footprint is reflected on forest characteristics. Our results show that human pressure on TDF came before 1970, significantly increased between 1970 and 2015 in the three regions, and change has been greater in the Orinoquia, where dry forests were mostly natural 50 years ago. We also found that this increased human impact has resulted in lower TDF cover, a higher forest fragmentation (smaller and narrower forest fragments), and forests with a higher proportion of secondary vegetation and shorter canopies in the three regions. These human footprint spatio-temporal analyses may inform conservation-based managing to prevent further degradation of the remaining dry forests under future scenarios of continuous economic development. © 2021 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jamie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: colombia,agriculture context",,

Under Ecuadorian law one of the principal ways to protect private lands is to declare them as protected forests and vegetation. These areas for the most part do not receive funding from the government but their designation does provide some legal support when the inevitable conflicts in land use arise. Cerro Blanco, which was designated a protected forest in 1989 via government decree, is one of the earliest and also most consolidated of the protected forests. With support from the private sector, principally Holcim, which has a cement-producing plant in the forest buffer zone, Fundación Pro Bosque has set up a broad-based management program that includes control and vigilance, dry forest restoration, environmental education and interpretation, scientific investigation, and community development. This article provides a perspective of establishing protected areas in biodiverse areas facing many challenges, including rapid urban expansion, poorly regulated land use, and encroachment.

Many studies have evaluated the inclination to conserve watersheds, forest areas, or certain species. In this study, we reported the economical values of medicinal species based on the perceptions of locals living within a protected area in a seasonal dry tropical forest in Northeastern Brazil. Moreover, we assessed the effects of socioeconomic variables (gender, family income, and family size) on the WTA compensation for not using the species. We interviewed 96 household heads from seven communities to obtain their socioeconomic data and WTA values. Additionally, we used data from a plant inventory to gather information on species abundance. We found that the selected socioeconomic variables are a poor predictor of the WTA values. Our findings also demonstrate that women accept lower WTA values to not use some species. Additionally, individuals from bigger families accept lower WTA values to not use just one of the plant species. Species abundance did not influence informants’ WTA values. Generally, informants overestimated bids, which may hinder biodiversity conservation. Socioeconomic and ecological factors may not have an influence on WTA values in communities that inhabit protected areas. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jamie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: brazil",,

The Paranã River Basin has the most significant dry forest formations in the Cerrado biome of central Brazil and is threatened by intense land conversion to pastures and agriculture. We examined changes in Paranã River Basin deforestation rates and fragmentation across three time intervals that covered 31 yr using Landsat imagery. Our results indicated a 66.3 percent decrease in forest extent between 1977 and 2008, with an annual rate of forest cover change of 3.5 percent. Landscape metrics further indicated severe forest loss and fragmentation, resulting in an increase in the number of fragments and reduction in patch sizes. Forest fragments in flatlands have virtually disappeared and the only significant forest remnants are mostly found over limestone outcrops in the eastern part of the basin. If current patterns persist, we project that these forests will likely disappear within 25 yr.

This study analysed Venezuelan dry forests at multiple scales, assessing status, present threats and the policy context shaping their future. Historical and current dry forest cover at both national and local scales were contrasted, and a set of quantitative risk assessment criteria applied. While dry forests were vulnerable nationally, in northern-central locations they were endangered. Clearing for cattle ranching and for intensive and subsistence agriculture were the principal factors driving dry forest loss at the national scale, while at a local level, urbanization and fire seemed to be the primary threats. The analysis emphasized the separation of risk assessment from the very different task of establishing conservation priorities; high risk areas may not necessarily be the highest priority for investment, and policy makers may become explicitly aware of the spatial scale at which their policies are implemented, as well as how these policies may affect or be affected by the status of ecosystems beyond their area of influence. The main challenge to future dry forest conservation is a paucity of explicit policies for management and use. However, scientifically-based management can support positive dry forest policies in many ways, including identifying locations and protocols for ecological restoration, maintaining seed banks, quantifying baseline conditions, and monitoring genetic diversity and other indicators. © 2009 Foundation for Environmental Conservation.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jamie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: threats,Venezuela",,

Based on Landsat satellite images, we analyzed changes in forest cover and landscape configuration over an area of 600 by 100 km located in NW Argentina (Tucumán and Salta provinces) in four periods between 1972 and 2007. The study area, one of the most active deforestation frontiers of South American dry forest, was divided into six relatively homogeneous sectors in terms of land property structure and biophysical characteristics. During the study period 1.4 millions hectares of dry forest were cleared. Deforestation started in the 1970s as a result of technological changes and increasing rainfall; continued (with spatial and temporal fluctuations) during the 1980s and 1990s in association to the sustained global demand of soybean, and was accelerated (to ca. 100,000 ha year-1) between 2001 and 2007 following the global increase in commodity prices, and the national peso devaluation. We described the landscape structure using eight landscape indices, summarized as one synthesis value: the Euclidian distance across the seven dimensions from a theoretical non-fragmented situation. In areas with soil limitations deforestation resulted in relatively stable, highly fragmented landscapes. In contrast, the sites with regional coarser-scale limitations (rainfall), deforestation produced a less fragmented landscape where agriculture concentrates in sites with high rainfall. Sites with no limitations for agriculture tend to a largely deforested landscape with few small and poorly connected forest patches. The land properties size seems to influence some indices of fragmentation, but the synthetic index of fragmentation suggests an overall convergence of fragmentation patterns towards a similar configuration across different biophysical and land tenure conditions. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Cacao agroforests in tropical rainforest areas have been shown to support higher bird and bat biodiversity than other land-use systems, but their suitability for tropical dry forest biodiversity remains unclear. We present the first assessment of bird and bat diversity patterns in cacao agroforests inside tropical dry forest landscapes. We investigated the response of bird and bat species richness and abundance to forest distance and season across 12 smallholder, organic cacao agroforests and adjacent tropical dry forests in the Peruvian lowlands of Piura. We found that insectivorous bird abundance and species richness increased with forest distance in the dry but not in the rainy season, indicating the value of cacao agroforests for these birds when resources are scarce in forests. In the case of bats, we observed more species in agroforests with increasing forest distance independent of season, and the abundance of insectivorous species increased along the gradient. Other dietary groups and forest specialists of both taxa did not vary notably across the forest distance gradient. Our findings point to the relevance of cacao agroforests as alternative habitats for insectivorous birds and bats in tropical dry forest landscapes, especially during the dry season. We suggest that the maintenance of wildlife friendly cacao agroforests, parallel to dry forest conservation and restoration, creates win-win situations for both the conservation of tropical dry forest fauna and the maintenance of related ecosystem services from which cacao smallholders may benefit. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jamie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: farming context",,

Such knowledge can be the result of scientific investigation, but important insight can also reside in observant local land managers. In seasonally dry tropical forests in southern Ecuador, recent decades have seen important advances in the knowledge of the biodiversity values of these forests, but the available data have not yet been integrated and translated into tools that support managers in deciding restoration measures. One powerful framework to organize and communicate information about ecosystem degradation and recovery dynamics is the state-transition model. We generated such a model by combining ecologist and local knowledge obtained through an adaptation of the Stanford/SRI expert elicitation protocol. Through this information, we identified five forest states with specific attributes of vegetation, human pressures, and restoration needs. Ecologists and locals agreed on the restoration actions but partially disagreed on the causes of degradation. Whereas ecologists considered that grazing management, often introduced with or after logging, was the catalyst for a transition to degraded states, locals attributed those transitions to the effects of logging alone. Importantly, however, both ecologists and locals considered that exclusion of livestock grazing was a necessary action to promote ecological recovery. A forward-looking strategy focusing on objectives for ecosystem recovery and ecosystem management for biodiversity and human well-being might be more successful than strategies that emphasize or seek to attribute responsibility for degradation. © 2019 by the author(s).","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jamie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: ecuador",,

This study focuses on the north-west boundary of the Argentine Semi-arid Chaco, where soybean is the most important crop. Deforestation was estimated for areas with different levels of soil and rainfall limitation for agriculture between 1972 and 2001, with a finer analysis in three periods starting in 1984, which are characterized by differences in rainfall, soybean price, production cost, technology-driven yield and national gross domestic product. Between 1972 and 2001, 588 900 ha (c. 20% of the forests) were deforested. Deforestation has been accelerating, reaching &gt;28 000 ha yr-1 after 1997. The initial deforestation was associated with black bean cultivation following an increase in rainfall during the 1970s. In the 1980s, high soybean prices stimulated further deforestation. Finally, the introduction of soybean transgenic cultivars in 1997 reduced plantation costs and stimulated a further increase in deforestation. The domestic economy had little association with deforestation. Although deforestation was more intense in the moister (rainfall &gt;600 mm yr-1) areas, more than 300 000 ha have already been deforested in the drier areas, suggesting that climatic limitations are being overcome by technological and genetic improvement. Furthermore, more than 300 000 ha of forest occur in sectors without major soil and rainfall limitations. If global trends of technology, soybean markets and climate continue, and no active conservation policies are applied, vast areas of the Chaco will be deforested in the coming decades. © 2005 Foundation for Environmental Conservation.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jamie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: chaco,argentina",,

For the Dry Chaco in South America, one of the largest remaining dry forests of the world, we describe the geographical distribution, type of production systems, environmental and social context and output of charcoal based on remote sensing (charcoal kiln detection); together with existing environmental (forest cover/biomass), social (population density, poverty), and infrastructure (roads) data. While most of the region has low kiln densities (&lt;1 kiln every 1000km2), foci of higher production were found in the north of Santiago del Estero and the west of Chaco provinces (&gt;1 kiln every 5km2). Individual or small groups (up to three units) prevail over the regions (58.2% of all kiln sites), frequently associated with a forest land cover. Large groups of kilns (≥12 units, 15.5% of all kilns) were associated with land cleared for cultivation. For a subset of kiln sites for which forest biomass data was available, we found that typical kiln sites (1-3 kilns) had half of the average biomass of the region within a radius of 125m. Although charcoal production in the whole region has been stable for 50years, a strong redistribution from richer to poorer provinces has taken place. At the county level, kiln density and charcoal production records showed a linear association that suggests an average output of 11 tons of charcoal per year per kiln. Comparing counties with high vs. low charcoal production with similarly high forest cover, the first had higher population density and poverty levels. Today small scale charcoal production by poor rural people represents the only significant use of forests products that provides some market incentive for their preservation. However this situation is associated with marginal social conditions, inefficient production, and forest degradation. Developing charcoal production under environmentally and socially virtuous conditions should be seen as a unique opportunity and an urgent challenge in the face of the fast deforestation of dry forests. © 2015 International Energy Initiative.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jamie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: chaco,argentina",,

We recognized 14 groups of land users of local or foreign origin, composed by individuals or corporative organizations, and dedicated either to pasture or crop production, or its combination. These groups displayed a wide variation in the scale of their operations as suggested by a 60-fold difference in paddock sizes. Twelve years of MODIS-NDVI data showed small and non-significant differences in the magnitude of primary productivity (1.2-fold difference) but strong contrasts in its seasonality and long-term variability, including shifts in the rates of vegetation greening and browning (up to 4-fold differences), growing period length (193 to 278 daysy-1), number of cultivation seasons per year (1-1.75), and inter-annual coefficient of variation (up to 0.13). Agriculture under capitalized groups was characterized by very large paddocks, less stable productivity patterns, and more divergent seasonality. Instead, all smallholders showed more stable productivities both seasonally and inter-annually.

rayyan-335336258,The role of soybean production as an underlying driver of deforestation in the South American Chaco,2017,1,1,,,45,,,"Fehlenberg V., Baumann M., Gasparri N.I., Piquer-Rodriguez M., Gavier-Pizarro G., Kuemmerle T.",,,,,"South America's tropical dry forests and savannas are under increasing pressure from agricultural expansion. Cattle ranching and soybean production both drive these forest losses, but their relative importance remains unclear. Also unclear is how soybean expansion elsewhere affects deforestation via pushing cattle ranching to deforestation frontiers. To assess these questions, we focused on the Chaco, a 110 million ha ecoregion extending into Argentina, Bolivia, and Paraguay, with about 8 million ha of deforestation in 2000–2012. We used panel regressions at the district level to quantify the role of soybean expansion in driving these forest losses using a wide range of environmental and socio-economic control variables. Our models suggest that soybean production was a direct driver of deforestation in the Argentine Chaco only (0.08 ha new soybean area per ha forest lost), whereas cattle ranching was significantly associated with deforestation in all three countries (0.02 additional cattle per hectare forest loss). However, our models also suggested Argentine soybean cultivation may indirectly be linked to deforestation in the Bolivian and Paraguayan Chaco. We furthermore found substantial time-delayed effects in the relationship of soybean expansion in Argentina and Paraguay (i.e., soybean expansion in one year resulted in deforestation several years later) and deforestation in the Chaco, further suggesting that possible displacement effects within and between Chaco countries may at least partly drive forest loss. Altogether, our study showed that deforestation in the Chaco appears to be mainly driven by the globally surging demand for soybean, although regionally other proximate drivers are sometimes important. Steering agricultural production in the Chaco and other tropical dry forests onto sustainable pathways will thus require policies that consider these scale effects and that account for the regional variation in deforestation drivers within and across countries. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jamie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: chaco,land use,argentina,socioeconomic,farming context",,

Contrary to our expectations, protected areas did not include higher biodiversity, although they showed higher densities of species specifically targeted for human harvest. Wichí properties were the most original regime in terms of community composition of birds and trees.

The application of the PROMETHEE multi-criteria method integrates a private cost–benefit analysis that describes the policy effects on farms and a contingent valuation study that describes the valuation of forest ecosystem services by the urban population of that region. The impact of five policy alternatives considering seven sustainability criteria was simulated. Criteria weighting was applied taking into account the preferences of theoretical decision-maker profiles and workshop participants. Our study finds that the most preferred alternatives are extension programs with and without prohibition of deforestation. The multi-criteria decision analysis shows an almost generalized coincidence, both in the simulation of theoretical weightings and in the workshop: The reforestation program with prohibition of deforestation is the best performance alternative, while deregulation is the alternative with the worst performance. Only when considering a free-market profile, deregulation has the best performance. It is concluded that multi-criteria methods facilitate the decision-making process, assessing policy alternatives by means of a wide range of criteria and by enabling different actors to express their preferences. Consequently, it constitutes a useful tool to support public decision making, particularly for policies related to the conservation of dry forests at local and global scales. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jamie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: caldenal,argentina",,

The main goals of this study are to understand how the rural communities of the Brazilian dry forest (Caatinga) recognize and classify different landscape units and to compare the folk classification thus obtained with scientific classification systems of Caatinga landscapes. A combination of semi-structured interviews, participatory mapping, and guided tours conducted with 51 participants in ten municipalities allowed the identification of nineteen landscape units. The comparison between the folk and scientific classifications of this biome reveals a good correspondence in several cases. However, regular and poor correspondences between scientific and folk classifications have been recorded as well. One of the identified differences was the greater number of landscape units recognized by the interviewees, which is likely connected to a high number of landscapes with similar features, but different dominant species, as well as the presence of anthropogenic landscapes in the folk classification. Since most of the Caatinga is constituted of landscapes modified by human activity, landscape ethnoecological studies on this biome may offer a more realistic and dynamic classification, complementing former classifications based exclusively on academic knowledge. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jamie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: brazil,caatinga,land system focus",,

In this study, we assessed the effects of subsistence farming on losses of organic nutrient pools in 10 independent sites that were distributed in five districts of two states. Each site had adjacent areas under dry forest and subsistence farming. Areas under each land use were separated in two groups that had different degrees of land degradation. Group assignment was based on land use history and visual observations of vegetation-soil degradation and was further evaluated using 137Cs activity to estimate erosion. Four combinations of land use degradation were defined: undisturbed (UDF) and disturbed (DDF) dry forest, and preserved (PC) and degraded (DC) cultivated land. Soils were sampled in the 0- to 7.5- and 7.5- to 15-cm layers. The 137Cs concentrations declined in the order UDF &gt; DDF ≈ PC &gt; DC. Soil C and N concentrations in DC (8.9 and 0.94 g kg-1 soil, respectively) were half of those in UDF (17.8 and 1.51 g kg-1 soil, respectively). The organic P (P 0)/ inorganic P (Pi) ratio was 1.47 in UDF and decreased to 0.82 in PC and DC. Carbon losses in DC were attributed to erosion (43%) and to mineralization (57%) processes. Differences between UDF and other land uses were greater in the 0 to 7.5 cm than in the 0- to 15-cm layer. Carbon and N losses in low-P status soils, in addition to limited water availability and unsuitable land management techniques, are likely to restrict the recovery of degraded soils by traditional bush fallow techniques.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jamie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: brazil,land-use history",,

The edible fruits of this indigenous tree from the Chiquitanian dry forest eco-region, are harvested by indigenous communities, processed by a producers' association and marketed mainly in the Santa Cruz district. Although obstacles exist, building up a commercial Chiquitanian almond sector is a promising avenue for socio-economic development. It provides opportunities for indigenous families to earn an additional income, becoming part of a strategy to reduce risks by diversifying production and economic activities. The emergence of outlets for Chiquitanian almonds has fostered a spontaneous protective attitude towards the species among producers, although at present this is limited to individual spaces such as fields, pastures and courtyards. More than urging rural communities to preserve the integrity of forest areas, this kind of development encourages them to establish plantations. Nevertheless, the context and the ecological characteristics of this leguminous fodder tree favour its plantation as part of agro-forestry or sylvopastoral systems, which are not widespread in this eco-region. This option would therefore help to mitigate the negative effects of agro-pastoral development, by promoting more environmentally sound practices. An increasing number of private livestock farmers are taking up this technical option, and Dipteryx alata could become a key to promoting reforestation of man-made pastures.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jamie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: NTFP,bolivia,chiquitano,socioeconomic",,

With the growing recognition of the failures of fire suppression policies and the relevance of local peoples’ practices, the Brazilian and Venezuelan governments have begun to shift to fire management policies in savanna ecosystems. Using case studies from protected areas in Cerrado and Gran Sabana, and results from two multi-stakeholder meetings held in Parupa (Venezuela) and Brasilia (Brazil), we identify advances, resistances and challenges to inter-cultural fire management in both countries. We show that the two regions host pioneer experiences in collaborative research based on improved dialogue and knowledge exchanges between scientists, institutions, Indigenous and local communities as well as fire management implementation including “controlled” and “prescribed” burnings. However, in some places, narrow understanding of the complexity and historical dynamics of local fire practices and the strong resistance to recognise the value of traditional fire knowledge might restrain effective participation of local communities. We argue that more collaborative research is necessary to support community owned solutions for intercultural and participative fire management in changing environmental and socio-cultural contexts.

However, despite its social importance and its capacity for having environmental impacts, there are no studies that evaluate the dynamics of the collection of this resource in relation to temporal factors in the semi-arid regions of Brazil. Thus, the main purpose of this study was to show that the seasonality of the savanna climate might influence local patterns of collecting firewood. Between December 2008 and February 2010, interviews and eleven in situ inventories were performed in the residences of two rural communities in the municipality of Soledad in the state of Paraíba (Northeast Brazil). During the in situ inventories, all stocks were measured (m 3), and species diversity was recorded. A total of 22 species were cataloged, but the pressure of collection was not distributed across all plants; there was a small group of species that were collected throughout the year, and these were found more frequently and with greater abundance in the residences. Although species richness was not influenced by seasonality, the volume of wood varied significantly between the dry and rainy seasons. More collections are performed in the dry season, and the local vegetation suffers greater extraction pressure from this use. The results obtained reinforce the need for studies that examine the potential for regrowth, plant productivity after selective cutting and the resting time necessary before performing a new cutting cycle, as this is the only way to better understand the implications regarding the use of firewood and its effects on local conservation. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jamie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: brazil,caatinga,actor focus",,

Dry and wet periods during the Upper Pliocene and Lower Pleistocene formed a geomorphically complex landscape in the Upper Paraguay Basin, covered by the Pantanal. The actual hydrological cycle of the Pantanal is characterized by a monomodal, predictable, annual flood pulse, however also with multiannual wet and dry periods. During high floods, ~110,000 km2 of the Pantanal are flooded, but during very dry periods only ~5,500 km2 are covered by water. The hydrological dynamics in combination with geomorphological heterogeneity have given rise to a very large macrohabitat diversity that provides the basis for a large biodiversity. This diversity, which includes aquatic, wetland, and many terrestrial species, is evidence of the important interactions among aquatic, terrestrial, and intermittent macrohabitats. Flora and fauna are dominated by species from the surrounding savanna (cerrado biome), but there are also species from the Amazon, chaco, and dry forest biomes. However, in the Pantanal, there are very few endemic species, because paleoclimatic and hydrologic instability hindered speciation. Cattle ranchers, who actually own 90% of the land in the Pantanal have slowly modified its vegetation cover for the last 200 years. Nonetheless, habitat and species diversity have been maintained because of low-density cattle herds. In recent years, economic pressure on the ranches has increased, forcing ranchers to augment cattle production. This has resulted in accelerated deforestation, the planting of artificial pastures, the draining of swamps, and the construction of dikes. Additional, external stress factors have also affected the Pantanal. These factors include the construction of hydroelectric dams along the headwaters, changing the natural flood regime, increased sediment input from upland agroindustries into the rivers, pollution by agrochemicals, mercury input from gold mining, and liquid and solid wastes from cities along the rivers entering the Pantanal. The recently established New Forest Code (Federal Law no. 12.561/12) left large stretches of riverine wetlands along the headwaters and along the Pantanal itself unprotected.

At that time, beekeepers in the national forest of Tumbes had more than one hundred colonies (trunk hives). Bee management required a minimum of knowledge on insect biology, notably to carry out artificial swarming, experience in spotting wild swarms and skill at maintaining nests in hives. Today, meliponiculture is becoming marginalized to the point of disappearing in many localities in the Northwest of Peru. As honey is a popular product (medical use), the hunting of the native honeybee species is becoming a more frequent practice. It is very harmful for the insects, even if this practice is tolerated by authorities, as nests are destroyed during the gathering of honey from wild bee colonies. The beekeepers also hunt wild swarms of melipona to keep as livestock due to the high level of hive desertions. The worrisome situation of stingless bee beekeeping in the Department of Tumbes results from: global environmental degradation, bad breeding conditions, and the powerlessness of the authorities who focus their priorities on supporting modern beekeeping development.Moreover, the regional long-term decline in stingless bee beekeeping corresponds to the arrival of European honey bees in the late 1970s.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jamie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: peru,apiculture,farming context",,

However, in Canaima National Park and World Heritage Site in southeastern Venezuela, since 1981 managers have employed a costly fire control program to eliminate savanna burning by the Pemon indigenous people. Here I present the results of the first study on Pemon perspectives of fire management in the park. I show that savanna burning is an important tool in indigenous land management and plays a key role in preventing large catastrophic fires. Pemon knowledge of fire also raises questions about conventional interpretations of environmental change in the park. Lastly, I recommend a fire management policy that seeks to integrate local ecological knowledge. This will require: (a) greater openness from scientists and resource managers to understanding Pemon rationale for the use of fire, (b) clarification among the Pemon themselves of their own views of fire, and (c) research partnerships among scientists, resource managers and the Pemon in order to encourage understanding of Pemon ecological knowledge of fire, and to assess its true impact in the Canaima National Park. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2006.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jamie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Venezuela,indigenous,actor focus,burning context",,

To develop better management strategies, it is necessary to analyse the dynamics of these forests at different scales and to assess their potential to recover from natural or human disturbances. This study combines broad and fine scales to investigate temporal changes: at broad scale we use aerial photos (from 1949, 1962, and 1999) and GIS to document land-cover change during a long-term period of 50 years; at fine scale we use spatial gradient analyses to document changes in species composition during a short-term period of four years. Re-sampling of the same elevational gradient (100-460 m a.s.l.) provides both a spatial and temporal gradient. Plausible causal links between human impact and documented changes are evaluated by means of ordination and Monte Carlo permutation tests. Density and diversity of seedlings, juveniles, shrubs, and trees were investigated in permanent plots from 2003 to 2007 along an elevational gradient. Approximately 17% of the forest has been lost during the last 50 years; giving an annual forest decline of 0.33%. The forest degradation during the 50 years in northern Peru was mainly due to agricultural expansion. During 1949-1962 forest declined by only 1.7%, while a greater forest decline took place during 1962-1999 (15% decline). Reasons for the greater forest loss during 1962-1999 are discussed. A new agrarian land reform from 1969 and population increases are likely reasons. The gradient analyses show a clear increase in species richness and spatial turnover in species composition along the elevational gradient. The ordination analysis reveals a significant change in species composition from 2001 to 2005, and we hypothesise that this may relate to browsing and logging activities. Although the number of faeces and signs of logging did not have a significant correlation with the ordination axes, the Monte Carlo permutation test in redundancy analysis (RDA) reveals a significant effect of browsing on species composition. The changes in species richness and species composition with elevation may be due to climatic differences between the lowland and upland mountain study area, rather than different intensity of human land use. Browsing and logging activities take place quite evenly over the entire study area, rather than being restricted to a certain area. Re-sampling of the permanent plots reveals that the lowland species Prosopis pallida was the only species able to survive from seedling stage to juvenile stage during the four-year investigation period. About 30% of the Prosopis pallida seedlings developed into juveniles, which indicates that this species may be better adapted to drought than other species in this environment.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jamie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: peru,land-use history",,

Land uses associated with these ecosystems have influenced economies from household to country scales, shaping social-ecological organization across the region since pre-Hispanic societies. Recent studies suggest that tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and forests represent alternative ecosystem states. Transitions between these ecosystem states can be promoted by changes in disturbance regimes and by land uses determined by the organization of societies and their activities. We analyzed how changes in agriculture, fire, and livestock management influenced forest cover over a 45-year span (1966-2011) in the Campos region, an extensive subtropical ecotone between rain forests and grasslands of South America. We found that forests contracted in areas with high crop agriculture, whereas forests increased in those grasslands where livestock densities had been reduced. These patterns were strongly associated with soil and topographic conditions because they broadly determine the potential land productivity and use. Our results show that current land use and disturbance regimes explain the large extent of grasslands across the South American Campos and suggest that changes in land use and disturbance regimes could facilitate or prevent transitions between subtropical forests, savannas, and grasslands altering the provision of ecosystem services linked to them. © 2019 by the author(s).","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jamie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: campos,argentina",,

However, our understanding of how natural resource use affects natural ecosystems is insufficient. The Caatinga is the most populated dry forest worldwide, and inhabitants depend largely on the exploitation of the natural ecosystem for several purposes such as fuelwood and raising livestock. These constitute 'chronic anthropogenic disturbances' (CAD), the impacts of which, in the long run, may compete with habitat loss and impacts on ecosystem health. In this chapter I present a theoretical framework for the assessment of the impacts of three main sources of CAD on the Caatinga. I discuss how (1) firewood harvesting, (2) raising of free ranging goats, and (3) biological invasion are all linked to changes observed in the Caatinga biota. These sources of CAD are all linked to the socio-economic condition of human populations inhabiting the Caatinga and can be understood and, to some extent, quantified through socio-economic assessments. Finally, I propose a theoretical framework on how the original features of the Caatinga ecosystem may change as a function of the intensity of CAD, leading to two alternative states of both conserved and altered similarity to the original ecosystem. Understanding natural resource use by human populations is crucial to being able to assess the threats to biodiversity and ecosystem functions properly as well as to design conservation strategies to avoid both ecosystem degradation and depletion of human livelihoods. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jamie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: brazil,caatinga,farming context",,

An intensive recent occupation process has transformed it into the most important region for cattle ranching and intensive commodity crops in Brazil. In this study, a macroecological approach was used to evaluate broad-scale spatial patterns of habitat loss in the Brazilian Cerrado, applying a series of spatial autocorrelation and partial regression analyses to understand how the proportion of remaining natural habitats is correlated with socio-economic variables, expressing different dimensions of human occupation and climatic variation. On average, 59% of the area is occupied by natural remnants at the spatial scale analyzed, although patterns of habitat loss are strongly spatially structured, with a Moran's I spatial autocorrelation coefficient equal to 0.825 ± 0.055 (p < 0.001). The partial regression analysis explains 89% of variation in percentage of natural remnants. The highest proportion of variance is explained by the multiple overlap between human occupation, climatic variation and geographic structure (67%), as well as by the climatically structured component of human occupation (8%). Based on the space-time interactive process of human occupation in the biome, future scenarios should be rather pessimistic. If the wave of human occupation continues towards the northern parts of the biome, as expected, we can predict that percentages will decline rapidly including even stronger losses of habitat at the biome scale.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jamie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: brazil",,

Ecologists consider that soils, hydrology, and seasonal precipitation influence the structure and composition of plants and the fire-proneness of savannas. However, the human influence on these dynamics remains uncertain. This is because little is known about human activities and what influence they have on the diversity of ecosystems. Considering this, our study sought to synthesize the management practices used by small-scale societies of the South American savannas, compile the species that are the focus of direct management, and demonstrate the role of this management in maintaining the diverse ecosystems that make up the savannas. We also set out to test the hypotheses that forms of management differ depending on the ecosystem and cultural matrices. To do so, we conducted a systematic review, in which we collected 51 articles with information about the management carried out by small-scale societies. From this, we categorized 10 management practices directed to ecosystems: protection of the ecosystem, enrichment of species, topographic changes, increased soil fertility, cleaning, prevention of fire, resource promotion, driving of game, swidden-fallow, and maintenance of ecosystem structure. We identified 19 native plant species whose populations are managed in-situ. These management practices have proven capable of keeping savanna and grassland ecosystems open and increasing the occurrence of forest ecosystems in the mosaic, as well as favoring plants of human interest in general. We note that there is a relationship between management practices with ecosystems and cultures, which suggests that both factors influence the management of landscapes. We conclude that management practices of small-scale societies are responsible for domesticating South American tropical savannas and that these savannas are composed of a mosaic of culturally constructed niches. The small-scale societies that inhabit these environments have important traditional ecological knowledge and strategies that enable the use, conservation, and restoration of savannas, extremely threatened by agribusiness today.

Added to the Amazon, the Brazilian savanna (Cerrado) faces changes in fire regimes. Climatic changes and the recent weakening of environmental law enforcement are factors, but historic and large-scale trends and drivers of fire regimes must be analyzed. We discuss ecological and policy drivers of recent changes in fire regimes in the Cerrado, in order to highlight management strategies. The Cerrado has evolved with natural fires and anthropogenic fires are also common for millennia. In the past 50 years, wildfires tend to be concentrated in the late dry season and to occur every two / three years, causing serious damage in fire-sensitive vegetation. Apart from climatic variations, the drivers of wildfires are deforestation and fire suppression policies. Nearly half of the original vegetation of the Cerrado biome has disappeared largely due to agribusiness expansion. Fire is associated with deforestation in two ways: vegetation conversion to monocultures, and lack of fire management in the remaining native vegetation. Indeed, the attempts to exclude fires from this fire-prone ecosystem disrupted traditional fire management. Fire suppression policies lead to increased wildfire risks due to fuel load and the multiplication of sources of ignition (conflicts, roads). The recent advances in Integrated Fire Management in protected areas in the Cerrado are evident. However, the recent budget cuts by the Brazilian government in environmental management and research undermine the chances of decreasing occurrences of wildfires in this biodiversity hotspot. © 2020 Elsevier GmbH","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jamie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: fire,brazil,cerrado",,

In protected areas in the Brazilian savannas (Cerrado), the predominant management policy is fire suppression, reflecting a cultural heritage which considers that fire always has a negative impact on biodiversity. Here we compare resultant fire-regimes in Canastra National Park (CNP), southeast Brazil, associated with areas under and without fire suppression management, based on a 16-year Landsat imagery record. In open grasslands of the Canastra plateau (CP), firefighting is undertaken under government-sanctioned regulation, whereas in the Babilonia sector, non-sanctioned fire management is undertaken by small farmers to promote cattle grazing and cropping. Fire regimes in the Canastra sector are characterized by few, very large, late dry season wildfires recurring at intervals of two years. Fire regimes in lowlands of the Babilonia sector are characterized by many small-scale, starting at the beginning of the dry season (EDS). In Babilonia uplands fire regimes are characterized by higher frequencies of large fires. The study illustrates major challenges for managing fire-prone areas in conflict-of-interest regions. We suggest that management planning in CNP needs to effectively address: i) managing conflicts between CNP managers and local communities; and ii) fire management practices in order to achieve more ecologically sustainable fire regimes.

Environmental governance, the ""filter"" between human and biophysical systems, is considered in terms of two models in light of empirical evidence from a neoliberal frontier in the Brazilian Cerrado (savanna) ecoregion. Land-change analysis indicates that agricultural land uses increased from 12% of the study region in 1986 to 44% in 2000 and 55% in 2005, with a corresponding loss of native Cerrado. A prominent farming organization formed in 1990 has participated in or led several environmental policy initiatives. Evidence of both governance models is found, and dilemmas facing environmental activists and managers, as well as the farming sector, are presented.

With logging and mining seen as increasing threats to the region, it is necessary to look at methods for engaging stakeholders in monitoring the status of their natural resources. This paper presents the results of a pilot study carried out to investigate water use by the Makushi Amerindians, and collect baseline data on the hydro-morphological aspects of the waterways. Methods included informal interviews, the use of the River Habitat Survey (RHS), and water quality measurements. The results indicate the heavy reliance of the Makushi on the waterways for their daily lives, particularly on fishing. Although ponds and creeks are important sources of fish, the rivers provide much larger catches of a greater diversity of fish species, both in the wet and dry seasons. The physical characteristics of the water sources used by the Makushi are mainly associated with the surrounding habitat types: The savanna areas containing the more nutrient rich white-water rivers, and the tropical forest areas containing the less nutrient rich black-water rivers. This study indicates that at present there is no direct evidence of adverse impacts on the waterways used by the Makushi in terms of fish catches, habitat conditions and water quality. A monitoring scheme was set up using this study's outputs as a baseline from which any future changes can be compared. Further work is to be carried out over the next three years to produce monitoring and sustainable management procedures for the North Rupununi ecosystems, by linking the physical attributes of the environment to biodiversity and subsequently local livelihoods, and by building capacity of local stakeholders through training. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

A considerable part of South America's tropical and subtropical grain production regions can meet the growing world demand for products derived from this grain, such as proteins and high-quality oil. Brazil's southern region concentrates most of canola research and production, especially in the states of Rio Grande do Sul and Paraná. This centralization is fostered by the existence and proximity of industries that process grains, having easy access to cultivation and marketing techniques. The potential to compose crop rotation systems in the off-season and autumnwinter periods is another important factor. This possibility allowed the canola seed tropicalization and the crop expansion to subtropical regions such as the cerrado of Minas Gerais, Brazil. Thus, the present work's objective is elaborating a life cycle inventory (LCI) of canola production in the South of Brazil, considering its two main products, oil and bran. The life cycle inventory (ISO 14040 standards) involves collecting data and calculation procedures to quantify the production system's relevant inputs and outputs. The system's limits include canola agricultural production up to the vegetable oil extraction unit's outlet gate, a cradle-to-gate analysis. This study applies this methodology to evaluate the hotspots (critical points) that most contribute to the oil production chain's environmental impacts. The LCI preliminary results show that the agricultural phase has a fundamental role in the environmental impacts, standing out the emissions associated with the chemical fertilizers and diesel oil for transporting and harvesting. In the stages of drying the grains, extracting and degumming the oil, firewood is used to generate heat and steam, proving the environmental relevance of biomass for the generation of energy compared to the fossil fuels burning. Results show that reducing chemical fertilizers consumption and introducing alternative fuel on farms has paramount importance to make the canola oil and other oilseeds production more environmentally sustainable. © 2021, ETA-Florence Renewable Energies.

Upland rice has been used as a pioneer crop to open these areas for cultivation, and covered an area of more than 4.5 million ha during the 1970s and 1980s. The cultivars used in this system were tall, japonica types, with good tolerance to drought stress and a traditional bold grain type. Subsequently, the shift of rice to more favorable production zones and a change in consumer grain preference has required the development of a new class of aerobic rice cultivars. These were derived from crosses between upland and lowland cultivars, and they combine adaptation to unflooded (aerobic) soils with responsiveness to applied inputs. Crop financing policies take into consideration the climatic risk for different savannah micro-regions, which has been established using water balance models and GIS. Research recommendations have been developed to minimize climatic risk through appropriate date of planting and choice of variety. New varieties, japonica × indica derivatives, with improved plant type and duration and with desirable grain appearance and cooking behavior, provide an economically attractive option for farmers in stable cropping systems. Such varieties have been adopted by farmers both as a regular component of grain cropping systems and as a crop to assist in renewal of degraded pasture.

This biome has already lost 48.2 percent of its original floral cover and is being affected by an intense process of habitat fragmentation. The purpose of this article is to verify if and how governmental and non-governmental conservation measures are protecting the remaining native Cerrado vegetation and whether these measures are encouraging connectivity. Results show that the effects of conservation units are limited, since only 3.1 percent of the biome is within fully protected areas. It was also found that public agencies are much more involved in conservation planning than actions in the field. Conservation projects are often implemented in the same territories, leading to the squandering of resources and ineffective results. Another problem is that many projects are dependent on international organizations and resources. Conservation initiatives in areas under private ownership are rare and economic or fiscal incentives that support such initiatives are sporadic and inadequate. The article concludes by suggesting that the Cerrado should become the focus of specific conservation policies, integrating governments, civil society and economic sectors and actors, especially farmers.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jamie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: brazil,cerrado",,

Long dependent on the forest for day-to-day sustenance, rural dwellers now find the forest dependent on them for its very survival because the few small patches of typical primary tropical dry forest that still exist are rapidly disappearing. This disappearance parallels the loss of coastal dry forests in Brazil, the invasion of Costa Rican dry forests by alien grass, and the threats to Mediterranean dry forests. Despite the erosion of tropical dry forests around the world, rain forests continue to get most of the attention.

The use of landscape as rangelands for domestic herbivores benefits humans, but understanding its impacts on vegetation is crucial to sustainable strategies. Here we assessed how free-ranging domestic goats use mixed working landscapes in the largest dry forest of the Americas. We evaluated habitat use via GPS tracking and analysis of feeding preferences. Goats preferentially used open areas near human settlements and their impact on plant community may be negligible because they feed mostly on plants widely available in modified environments. Although free-ranging, the area of use was nearly constant (95.44 ha), but the size of herds varied (2–100 animals). Our study suggests that domestic goats can be considered dwellers of human-modified landscapes, foraging close to villages, on open (i.e., degraded) areas where abundant plant species thrive. Therefore, the extensive goat pastoralism in the Caatinga may have little impact on natural vegetation and could be sustainably managed under traditional management practices. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jamie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: brazi,caatinga",,

To balance increasing agriculture production and nature conservation, we must assess the efficiency of land-use strategies. Soybean production, mainly exported to China and Europe, has become the major driver of deforestation in dry forest/ savanna ecosystems of South America. In this article we compared land cover patterns (based on satellite imagery) and land-use and human population trends (based on government statistics) in regions with two contrasting development pathways in the Chaco dry forests of northern Argentina, since the early 1970s. The area (ca. 13 million hectares) includes one of the largest continuous patches of tropical dry forests and has experienced rapid land-use change. In the region where land use has been driven by government-sponsored colonization programs, the expansion of extensive grazing has led to a growing rural population, low food production, and widespread environmental degradation. In contrast, in the region dominated by market-driven soybean expansion, the rural population has decreased, food production is between 300% and 800% greater, and low-density extensive cattle production has declined over extensive remaining forested areas, resulting in a land-use trend that appears to better balance food production and nature conservation. © 2008 The Authors Journal compilation © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jamie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: chaco,argentina,land use pathways",,

In this empirical study, we assess the relationship between poverty and conservation goals in dry forests within a 62,000-ha Brazilian National Park (Caatinga biome). We conducted 81 structured household interviews between January and July of 2016 to assess socioeconomic, resource management and land-use variables. We used non-parametric analysis of variance to test for differences in socioecological variables among families living inside and outside the Park and both (double dwelling). The majority of families (76%) residing inside the Park were living below the poverty line while less than 14% in outside and double dwelling residences faced the same issue. Families living inside the park had lower socioeconomic conditions such as limited water availability, poor house infrastructure, low income, and high dependence on firewood than outside and double dwelling families. They were also more dependent on external financial support and natural resources. We found that failures in protected areas inception and implementation have driven people towards a mutually reinforcing and declining situation in which negative socioeconomic outcomes are associated with nature degradation.

This is particularly true for tropical and subtropical dry forests, where a variety of disturbances, both natural and anthropogenic, affect forest canopies. Addressing forest degradation thus requires a spatially-explicit understanding of the causes of disturbances. Here, we apply an approach for attributing agents of forest disturbance across large areas of tropical dry forests, based on the Landsat image time series. Focusing on the 489,000 km2 Argentine Dry Chaco, we derived metrics on the spectral characteristics and shape of disturbance patches. We then used these metrics in a random forests classification framework to estimate the area of logging, fire, partial clearing, riparian changes and drought. Our results highlight that partial clearing was the most widespread type of forest disturbance from 1990–to 2017, extending over 5520 km2 (±407 km2 ), followed by fire (4562 ± 388 km2 ) and logging (3891 ± 341 km2 ). Our analyses also reveal marked trends over time, with partial clearing generally becoming more prevalent, whereas fires declined. Comparing the spatial patterns of different disturbance types against accessibility indicators showed that fire and logging prevalence was higher closer to fields, while smallholder homesteads were associated with less burning. Roads were, surprisingly, not associated with clear trends in disturbance prevalence. To our knowledge, this is the first attribution of disturbance agents in tropical dry forests based on satellite-based indicators. While our study reveals remaining uncertainties in this attribution process, our framework has considerable potential for monitoring tropical dry forest disturbances at scale. Tropical dry forests in South America, Africa and Southeast Asia are some of the fastest disappearing ecosystems on the planet, and more robust monitoring of forest degradation in these regions is urgently needed. © 2022 by the authors.

Although this is widely accepted, empirical examples, particularly involving deforestation in Latin America, are still very few. The geographic extent and causes of deforestation in subtropical seasonally dry forests of the world have received very little attention. This is especially true for the Chaco forests in South America, which are being lost at an alarming rate, sometimes higher than those reported for tropical forests. On this basis, the aims of this study were to analyze the changes in land cover that have occurred during the last three decades of the 20th century in the Chaco forests of central Argentina, and to explain the factors that have driven those changes. Results show major land cover changes. Approximately 80% of the area that was originally undisturbed forest is now occupied by crops, pastures, and secondary scrub. The main proximate cause of deforestation has been agricultural expansion, soybean cultivation in particular. This appears as the result of the synergistic convergence of climatic, technological, and socioeconomic factors, supporting the hypothesis of a multiple-factor explanation for forest loss, while providing one of the very few existing analyses of changes in subtropical forests of the world. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jamie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: chaco,context,argentina,land use pathways",,

Current approaches to conservation are built on the premise that conservation and development are not antagonistic. Social conservationists advocate win–win solutions that both conserve biodiversity and promote human well-being. In this paper we explore how the conservation-development relationship is understood by a rural community in Colombia where remaining areas of tropical dry forest are threatened by human activities, and a payment for ecosystem services scheme, PES, is proposed as a conservation strategy. Q-methodology was used to identify and categorise local peoples’ perspectives on forest conservation. Four distinctive perspectives were found: Social Conservationism, Fair Development, Development Advocate and Government’s Responsibility. Social conservationism places more importance on forest conservation while the other three perspectives emphasise development. This suggests that the conservation program at the local level must be explicit about tensions and trade-offs. Not to do so can compromise the social acceptability of the PES scheme and therefore the conservation objective. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jamie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: colombia",,

Current pledges to expand global protected area coverage suggest a need for the critical analysis of governance quality and the way conservation interacts with the well-being of IPLCs. We present the case of Catimbau National Park in the Caatinga dry forest of northeast Brazil, where we explored connections between the well-being of IPLCs and landscape through different values, practices and institutions, and perceptions of how environmentally just the park's governance has been. The well-being of IPLCs is inextricably connected with the Caatinga landscape, through multiple place-based relational values that, although differing between Indigenous and non-indigenous inhabitants, have in both cases developed over generations. Although often framed as degraders, IPLCs exhibit a strong motivation to conserve, reflected through local institutions including forest gardens, sustainable use regulations, restoration activities and prevention of external encroachment. The strict form of protected area implemented at Catimbau, instead of a locally led or sustainable use reserve, explicitly targeted the resettlement of IPLCs and livelihood reorientation. These imposed objectives have clashed with a way of life in this peopled landscape and precluded local stewardship on a larger scale. Long-term conflict arose through governance deficiencies which sparked multidimensional injustices. These include not only the misrecognition of local values and customary institutions but also the lack of procedures for consent or decision-making influence, plus distributional harms including tenure insecurity and denied development assistance. Development and conservation strategies must reject narratives about poor, resource-dependent rural communities and embrace the opportunities that local knowledge and institutions bring for effective conservation. As conservation efforts are expanded post-2020, the people of the Caatinga and beyond must be recognised as embedded and a key part of any solution. In strict protected areas like Catimbau, where social conflict constrains their ability to function, seeking legal changes in governance type can be onerous. However, we describe other local-level actions to build relationships and agency that may foster transitions towards better governance, and just treatment of IPLCs.

Forest-dependent smallholders are particularly strongly impacted, as they crucially rely on forest resources, are typically poor, and often lack institutional support. Our goal was to assess forest-smallholder dynamics in relation to expanding commodity agriculture. Using high-resolution satellite images across the entire South American Gran Chaco, a global deforestation hotspot, we digitize individual forest-smallholder homesteads (n = 23,954) and track their dynamics between 1985 and 2015. Using a Bayesian model, we estimate 28,125 homesteads in 1985 and show that forest smallholders occupy much larger forest areas (>45% of all Chaco forests) than commonly appreciated and increasingly come into conflict with expanding commodity agriculture (18% of homesteads disappeared; n = 5,053). Importantly, we demonstrate an increasing ecological marginalization of forest smallholders, including a substantial forest resource base loss in all Chaco countries and an increasing confinement to drier regions (Argentina and Bolivia) and less accessible regions (Bolivia). Our transferable and scalable methodology puts forest smallholders on the map and can help to uncover the land-use conflicts at play in many deforestation frontiers across the globe.

Science-led but socially and economically anchored information on biodiversity will help to incorporate nature's contributions to people into the society's cultural values. Ultimately, these transformative actions will translate into the comprehensive management of TDF through a greater impact in decision making. Summary. Thousands of permanent plots have been established across the tropics with the purpose of monitoring tree communities. Research outcomes from these platforms, however, have been mainly directed toward the academic community, and their contribution to society has been limited so far. Here, we show how generating robust data on biodiversity has supported decision making in Colombian tropical dry forests (TDF), where less than 8% of their original cover remains. As a first step to build a national dialogue around the critical status of this ecosystem, a national collaborative network on TDF research and monitoring was born in 2014, the Red de Investigación y Monitoreo del Bosque Seco Tropical en Colombia (Red BST-Col). Our main goal is to generate scientifically sound information that feeds into the comprehensive management of this ecosystem. To do so, a set of biodiversity monitoring platforms has been established across the country, which have already served to answer socio-ecological questions related with deforestation drivers, citizen science, or the valuation of ecosystem services. Overall, this research agenda has nurtured the four lines that underpin the Program for the comprehensive management of dry forests in Colombia (knowledge management, preservation, restoration, and sustainable use), formulated by the Humboldt Institute, the United Nations Development Programme, and the Ministry of Environment in 2019.

For this purpose, we conducted a comparative analysis of two case studies, one study in the north of Minas Gerais state and the other in Paranã River Basin, situated in southeastern and central Brazil, respectively. We compiled published bibliographical and census-based data for the two regions, concerning the historical human occupation and land use and the environmental and development policies affecting TDF management and sustainable use. Brazilian TDFs usually occur in semi-arid climates, and have been intensely converted mainly to extensive pasturelands in large farms, thus leading to high income concentration in those areas. Our case studies involve less-developed regions that support populations with very low human development indices, which is the norm for Brazilian TDFs. Many of these are traditional populations, such as indigenous and slave descendents, with peculiar cultural practices only recently considered in government policies proposed for the forest management. Though the two regions have similar land use histories, current social-ecological scenarios are very different. In the north of Minas Gerais, TDF conversion policies were debated intensely for the last 15 years, recently resulting in a state law specifically generated to regulate TDF use. Also, this region has 20 conservation units (CUs), some of them delimited inside the territories of the several traditional populations that inhabit TDF areas. This process caused enduring conflicts that can affect both CUs' effectiveness and the sustenance of these populations. In the Paranã River Basin, there is no specific policy towards TDFs, whose use is regulated by the 43-year-old Brazilian Federal Forest Code. There are only four CUs in this region, and most traditional populations were expelled from their original territories and consequently lost their cultural identity. Government sustainability strategies are limited to the establishment of CUs, a response that may disregard social demands and cultural practices, depending on the local context. Given the uniqueness and threat level to TDFs, specific and more diversified policies towards land use should be established for these ecosystems in order to stimulate low-impact activities that maintain ecosystem services and improve the livelihoods of TDF inhabitants. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Understanding such preferences and needs by the community and stakeholder groups before actually assessing, modelling, and measuring the supply of ES is key for decision-making and planning in municipalities, as well as for the conservation of nearby neotropical dry forests. We studied these dynamics in a small rural municipality in Colombia with limited data availability using semi-structured interviews and surveys, as well as ES-proxies and geospatial analyses. We then analyzed the supply and importance of two community identified ES and one ED from adjacent neotropical dry forests during 2005–2017.

Increased temperatures and fires were the most important ED, while fires were also identified as an important driver of change. Air purification, via pollutant deposition to forest cover, remained approximately constant (116 ton/year), while food production (49 ton/ha) and fire occurrence, an ED, increased.

Drawing on qualitative and quantitative data obtained through semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders and members of communities surrounding a privately protected area in southern Ecuador, we identify that the level of collaboration with the managers, the distance to the protected area, the percentage of untitled land, and the dependence on the resources (customary uses) are among the variables affecting these perceptions and values. Positive perceptions towards protected areas and naturalistic values are developed among those who collaborate with the protected area managers, whereas negative perceptions, and a mix of naturalistic and biospheric values are developed among those who have a sense of a lack of attention to social needs although supporting nature conservation at the same time.

This study explored how to control deforestation in the region while securing the livelihoods of local people through land-use diversification and compensation payments. Results are based on interview data collected from 163 households near the Laipuna Reserve in southern Ecuador. Combining modern financial theory and von Thünen’s theory of land distribution, we optimized land-use shares of two types of forest management (banning and allowing goat grazing) and three crops (maize, beans and peanuts). Land-use portfolios were calculated for four different farm sizes, represented by the quartiles of the farm size distribution. We found that goat grazing was important for diversifying farm income and reducing financial risks for all farm sizes. However, forest area would still be converted to cropland under the current financial coefficients. The amount of compensation needed to maintain current forest cover was calculated for two different scenarios: 1) banning goat grazing and 2) allowing forest use where the farmer could decide how much forest area would be allocated to each land-use option. Offering financial compensation for forest preservation (Scenario 1) reduced deforestation but would still lead to a conversion of at least 23% of current forests to croplands. Allowing forest use in a compensation scheme (Scenario 2) would help retain 96% of the current forest cover, with 29% of this forest being set aside for conservation. This scenario would suppose annual payments ranging from $4 to $89 ha-1, with the largest farms requiring the lowest payments. In contrast, banning goats from the forest would even risk losing the entire forest area to cropland, if compensation fell below $50 ha-1 yr-1. We conclude that coupling productive options with secure compensation payments and developing policies that support land-use diversification and sustainable use of forest resources, will be most effective in conserving the Ecuadorian dry forest. © 2016, Erdkunde.

However, social, land-use and sustainability research disciplines often study each independently. We used Euclidean distance analyses of five indicators of land systems functioning to explore the geographical patterns of across-border human-induced asymmetries in transnational ecoregions of South America. The most asymmetric transnational ecoregions occurred in the tropical rainforest biome which also showed the widest range of asymmetry values compared to other biomes. In contrast, transnational ecoregions in montane grasslands showed comparatively little asymmetries, and tropical dry forests showed intermediate asymmetry values. This pattern indicates that major asymmetries occur in land systems located in productive biomes with a comparatively recent history of development, whereas mature socio-ecosystems with a long history of human land use are more homogeneous across borders. In some cases, asymmetries may stabilize as a consequence of reinforcing feedbacks that promote contrasting land-use decisions across borders, including, for example, the establishment of protected areas, or the promotion of agro-industrial activities. Transnational socio-ecological land systems can be used to evaluate alternatives for sustainable development because they highlight the influence of institutions under different governance regimes in defining the spatial configuration and ecological properties of regions. We invite land-use and sustainability scientists to consider political border interactions as valuable “natural experiments” to better understand the interrelations between biophysical and political systems in defining planetary geographical-ecology in the Anthropocene. © 2021, The Author(s).","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jamie""=>""Included""}",,

The Pampas and Chaco regions of Argentina have been global hotspots of agricultural land-use change since the 2000s, yet our understanding of what drives the spatial patterns of these land-use changes remains partial. We parameterized a net returns model of agricultural land-use change to estimate the probability of agricultural expansion (conversions of woodlands to either cropland or grazing land) and agricultural intensification (conversion of grazing land to cropland) at the 1-km scale for the years 2000 and 2010. Uniquely, our model allowed us to quantify the importance of underlying causes (i.e., changes in agricultural profit) and spatial determinants (i.e., soil fertility, distance to markets, etc.), for Argentina's prime agricultural regions as a whole. We found that cropland and grazing land expansion into woodlands was much less sensitive to changes in profit-related factors than agricultural intensification. Profit-related variables, were a particularly strong cause of intensification in the Pampas, where cropland profits rose by 29% (compared to 18% in the Chaco). This suggests that further conversions of grazing land to cropland in the Pampas and Chaco is likely as long as agricultural demand, and thus returns to agriculture, continue to be high. The moderate impact of profit-related factors on affecting woodland conversion rates also suggests a limited potential of economic policies that affect marginal profits (e.g., taxes or subsidies) to alter deforestation rates and patterns in major ways.

Within Latin American and the Caribbean region (LAC), many studies have documented extensive deforestation, but there are also many local studies reporting forest recovery. These contrasting dynamics have been largely attributed to demographic and socio-economic change. For example, local population change due to migration can stimulate forest recovery, while the increasing global demand for food can drive agriculture expansion. However, as no analysis has simultaneously evaluated deforestation and reforestation from the municipal to continental scale, we lack a comprehensive assessment of the spatial distribution of these processes. We overcame this limitation by producing wall-to-wall, annual maps of change in woody vegetation and other land-cover classes between 2001 and 2010 for each of the 16,050 municipalities in LAC, and we used nonparametric Random Forest regression analyses to determine which environmental or population variables best explained the variation in woody vegetation change. Woody vegetation change was dominated by deforestation (-541,835 km2), particularly in the moist forest, dry forest, and savannas/shrublands biomes in South America. Extensive areas also recovered woody vegetation (+362,430 km2), particularly in regions too dry or too steep for modern agriculture. Deforestation in moist forests tended to occur in lowland areas with low population density, but woody cover change was not related to municipality-scale population change. These results emphasize the importance of quantitating deforestation and reforestation at multiple spatial scales and linking these changes with global drivers such as the global demand for food. © 2012 by The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jamie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: demography",,

Analyzing and reconstructing those historical patterns helps to advance the understanding of the dynamics and persistence of present-day ecosystems. This article explores this reconstruction by identifying and analyzing historic drivers of landscape change for seven periods between 1500 and 2000, and presents historical land use maps showing major trends and impacts on natural ecosystems. Historic land use maps were built using an ecosystem map of 1998 and a ""preclearing"" ecosystem map, by constraining the spatial change of transformed areas using data on accessibility to rivers and roads, elevation, slope, moisture availability, and settlement areas. We estimate the transformed area rose from approximately 15 Mha in 1500 to 42 Mha in 2000, and land use changed from cropping in 1500 to predominantly grazing in 2000. Demographic impacts of colonization and the introduction of cattle were major drivers of change, but rates and trends of land cover change varied between regions and from period to period. The most impacted ecosystems have been the Andean and tropical dry forests, with the most recent trends toward clearing of humid lowland forests, especially in the Amazon and Pacific. Some landscapes have been subject to strong human influence continuously for more than 500 years, whereas others have been transformed for less than thirty years. We discuss the relevance of a historical approach for guiding conservation goals, ecological restoration efforts, and research hypotheses.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jamie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: colombia,land use pathways",,

Our analysis is based on a qualitative analysis of 24 semi-structured interviews and 30 documents. We discuss SFM and the interplay of resources, governance, and actors. Results for Caatinga show that (1) a technical approach to SFM that focuses on firewood and charcoal production is dominant; that (2) SFM implementation practices hardly address the needs and interests of local populations; and that (3) local actors show little support for the implementation of SFM. We conclude that the social-ecological context of Caatinga shapes translations of SFM mostly in a techno-bureaucratic rather than a socially embedded way.

We present a conceptual framework for deriving variably integrated, multi-metric measures of CAD from disparate disturbance indicators. Our framework has three steps: (1) identifying the main sources of CAD in the target region, and quantifying them using data of varying levels of spatial and intensity precision; (2) classifying the sources of disturbance into general disturbance pressures, and deriving an index for each; and (3) combining the individual disturbance pressure indices into a fully integrated index that characterizes the overall level of CAD. We apply this framework to Catimbau National Park in the Brazilian Caatinga, using 12 primary data sources to derive disturbance pressure indices relating to livestock, wood extraction and people pressure. The meaningfulness of pressure and overall CAD indices were validated by reference to variation in ant communities. Our analysis revealed notable findings. First, indirect measures from the geographic and socio-ecological context were poorly correlated with direct, field-based measurements, and were therefore of questionable reliability. Second, the three main disturbance pressures were largely independent of each other, which points to complex patterns of resource use by local communities. Third, different weightings of component disturbance pressure indices had little influence on the Global index, making our Global CAD index somewhat insensitive to assessments of the relative importance of different disturbance pressures. Finally, our results caution against a reliance on multivariate ordination to derive integrated indices of disturbance from disparate data sources. Our multi-scale integration of disturbance data can facilitate the analysis of the resource use effects on biodiversity, contributing to effective conservation management and sustainable livelihood development. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jamie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: brazil,caatinga",,

By involving stakeholders, whose actions are decisive in dealing with the problem under analysis, we assessed the interactions among processes of multiple dimensions and spatial scales, currently controlling communal forest degradation in 11 peasant communities of Taboada, Ibarra and Salavina departments, in Santiago del Estero province, Argentina. Then, by reconstructing historical processes undergone by these communities over the last century, we analyzed how different system settings have conducted to the system collapse (forests and community loss) or strengthened its adaptive capacity facing natural disturbances (droughts) and anthropogenic stressors (economic shocks, land disputes). This work unveils system attributes related to native resource management and economic diversification on the farm, family and community structure, and social networking with peasant organizations and other institutions, crucial for building social–ecological resilience. Alternative trajectories are shown towards degradation (throughout a downward spiral, often followed by peasant exodus and deforestation) or restoration.

In the hilly area, fragments of biodiverse tropical dry forest still exist in various states of conservation and degradation. To understand the interrelated social, economic, and ecological transformations in the area, we analyzed land use change on the local scale including the local community's perception, because the local community is a key actor for sustainable land use. For the analysis of the interrelated social, economic, and ecological processes, we combined visual interpretation of high-resolution satellite imagery, on-site field land use mapping, and a spatial statistical analysis of the distribution of land use classes with in-depth interviews and a participatory GIS workshop, thus benefitting from the complementary methodological strengths of these approaches. The case study is the rural community of El Morro, which exhibits the typical social, economic, and ecological changes of the coastal strip of the western peri-urban area of Barranquilla. The local community perceives a continuous loss of forest area, but observations from on-site field mapping cannot confirm this linear trend. We observed a gradual replacement of traditional land uses such as smallholder agriculture, charcoal production, and cattle breeding by services for tourism, gated community projects for urban dwellers, and infrastructure projects; these spatial developments have several characteristics of rural gentrification. We conclude that the drivers of environmental degradation have changed and the degradation increased.

Among these, the forests of the South American Gran Chaco are one of the global deforestation hotspots. The Argentine Dry Chaco has been the focus of several studies that assess the factors that drive forest conversion. However, these studies do not describe the causal relationships among these drivers and seldom use existing theory to select drivers. Here we employ a theory-driven approach to test the relative merits of alternative and complementary hypotheses to explain the drivers and mechanisms explaining the unequal spatial distribution of forest loss and maintenance in the Argentine Dry Chaco from 2000 to 2010. Using structural equation modeling, we quantified the direct and indirect effects of multiple drivers and compared the explanatory power and parsimony of these alternative hypotheses, i.e. the biophysical, infrastructure, socio-demographic, institutional, and the integration of them. For both forest loss and maintenance, the model containing infrastructural drivers had the best balance between parsimony and explanatory power. Integrated models, comprising a combination of drivers, had the highest explanatory power (R2 = 0.81 for forest maintenance, and R2 = 0.58 for forest loss). We show that biophysical constraints operate directly and indirectly: soil suitability had direct effects on forest cover maintenance, while precipitation affected it both directly and indirectly through influencing the institutional (land tenure) and infrastructure (road density). Indigenous communities positively affected forest maintenance both directly and indirectly mediated by non-private land tenure. Our results suggest that disentangling the structure of the relationships among drivers could increase our capacity for understanding and steering land-use change. Furthermore, policies for halting deforestation might increase their effectiveness by accounting for the mechanisms that underlie forest loss and maintenance. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jamie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: chaco,argentina",,

The present study aimed to quantify deforestation, forest recovery and net cover change in tropical dry forests (TDFs) in Brazil from 2007 to 2016, and investigate how they are associated to biophysical and socioeconomic factors. We also assessed the effects of LCC variables in human welfare indicators. For this purpose, we used MODIS imagery to calculate TDF gross loss (deforestation), gross gain (forest recovery) and net cover change (the balance between deforestation and forest recovery) for 294 counties in three Brazilian states (Minas Gerais, Bahia, and Piauí). We obtained seven factors potentially associated to LCC at the county level: total county area, road density, humidity index, slope, elevation, and % change in human population and in cattle density. From 2007 to 2016, TDF cover increased from 76,693 to 80,964 km2 (+5.6%). This positive net change resulted from a remarkable forest recovery of 19,018 km2 (24.8%), offsetting a large deforested area (14,748 km2; 19.2%). Practically all these cover changes were a consequence of transitions from TDF to pastures and vice-versa, highlighting the importance of developing sustainable policies for cattle raising in TDF regions. Each LCC variable was associated to different set of factors, but two biophysical variables were significantly associated both to TDF area gained and lost per county: county area (positively) and slope (negatively), indicating that large and flat counties have very dynamic LCCs. The TDF net area change was only associated (negatively) to the humidity index, reflecting an increase in TDF cover in more arid counties. The net increase in Brazilian TDF area is likely a result from an interplay of biophysical and socioeconomic factors that reduced deforestation and caused pasture abandonment. Although the ecological integrity and permanence of secondary TDFs need further investigation, the recovery of this semi-arid ecosystem must be valued and accounted for in the national forest restoration programs, as it would significantly help achieving the goals established in the Bonn agreement and the Atlantic Rain Forest pact. © Copyright © 2020 Espírito-Santo, Rocha, Leite, Silva, Silva and Sanchez-Azofeifa.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jamie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: brazil,context,minas gerais,socioeconomic",,

The aim was to understand the current state of governance in the region and identify clues for more sustainable land management. The use and conservation of Caatinga are negotiated at multiple levels, which are only sporadically interlinked. The conversion of forest land into alternative land uses shifts and shares responsibility among different sectors, while cross-sectoral cooperation is rarely observed.

Obstructing attitudes, such as thinking in dichotomies, and paternalistic and opportunistic approaches, are being addressed by some new coalitions taking alternative action.

At regional scale, however, both processes can occur simultaneously even in the absence of net change. Given the focus on net change, such redistribution of agricultural and natural and seminatural lands has been generally overlooked. The interaction between agriculture modernization, human demography and complex topographic gradients of northwestern Argentina has resulted in processes of both forest recovery and deforestation, thus providing the opportunity to analyze patterns and driving forces of land-cover redistribution. We analyzed 20 years (1986-2006) of land-cover change in a subtropical watershed in relation to topographic and demographic variables. Although net forest change represented <1 %, forests redistribution affected 7 % of forest lands. There was a consistent geographic segregation of deforestation and forest recovery, with forests expanding over steep highlands and agriculture expanding over lowland irrigated areas. Population trends were not associated to forest expansion in lowlands but they explained 32 % of forest recovery in highlands. Highland forest expansion and lowland deforestation, respectively, imply conservation opportunities for humid montane forests and the environmental services they provide (e.g., watershed conservation) and threats for the conservation of dry forests and its biodiversity.

Populations here have increased exponentially through immigration supplying labour to urban coastal development, and demonstrably unsustainable agro-industrial expansion for export markets. Society has become dislocated from local traditions of environmental and resource management whilst still retaining a wealth of Andean agricultural expertise. Indigenous communities still hold on to vestiges of traditional knowledge. Relicts of natural vegetation, traditional agriculture and agrobiodiversity continue to sustain ecosystem services. Moreover, offer livelihood options and resources for restoration. These aspects reflect a long cultural trajectory, including famous extinct cultures such as Nasca, that evolved within an ever-changing riparian and agricultural landscape influenced by external forces and which incorporated important processes of plant domestication and adaptation to climatic oscillation. Here, we present an ecosystem approach to vegetation restoration and sustainable resource management in Ica, Peru, based on wide interdisciplinary biodiversity inventory and study, where school, community and agro-industry engagement is seen as a prerequisite for success. The approach demonstrated significant plant establishment in this hyperarid region using appropriate low-technology techniques of planting and irrigation with minimum watering. Restoration of a highly degraded environment built upon vegetation relicts followed a strategy of cultural capacity building and environmental engagement, including the development of sustainable forest products, festivals, schools programmes, didactic publications for local use, and collaboration with local communities, landowners, agribusiness and governmental authorities. Plant conservation must re-engage people with their natural heritage by dissemination of information for vegetation restoration and management integrated to dynamics of ecosystem function within its wide local cultural and historical context. © 2011 The Board of Trustees of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jamie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: peru",,

These changes have effects on vegetation structure and recovery, species composition, and ecosystem function. Understanding how human management can affect fire regimes is vital to detect potential changes in the resilience of plant communities, and to predict vegetation responses to human interventions. We evaluated the fire regimes of two recently protected areas in Madagascar (Ibity and Itremo NPA) and one in Brazil (Serra do Cipó NP) before and after livestock exclusion and fire suppression policies. We compare the pre- and post-management fire history in these areas and analyze differences in terms of total annual burned area, density of ignitions, burn scar size distribution, fire return period and seasonal fire distribution. More than 90% of total park areas were burned at least once during the studied period, for all parks. We observed a significant reduction in the number of ignitions for Ibity NPA and Serra do Cipó NP after livestock exclusion and active fire suppression, but no significant change in total burned area for each protected area. We also observed a seasonal shift in burning, with fires happening later in the fire season (October–November) after management intervention. However, the protected areas in Madagascar had shorter fire return intervals (3.23 and 1.82 years) than those in Brazil (7.91 years). Our results demonstrate that fire exclusion is unattainable, and probably unwarranted in tropical grassland conservation areas, but show how human intervention in fire and vegetation patterns can alter various aspects of the fire regimes.

Scenarios are powerful tools to explore possible future changes in agricultural land use, how these may affect the environment, and how policies may influence land-use patterns. Focusing on Argentina's prime agricultural areas, the Pampas, Espinal and Chaco, we developed spatially-explicit future land-use scenarios from 2010 to 2030, considering both agricultural expansion (i.e., conversions from woodland to either grazing land or cropland) and agricultural intensification (i.e., conversions from grazing land to cropland). Our simulations were based on an econometric model of net returns, which assumes economically rational land-use actors. Using this model, we assessed the rates and spatial patterns of future land-use change under current land zoning in our study region, and contrasted this with a forecast of future land use based on land-conversion rates from 2000–2010. We systematically tested the impact of economic policies (e.g., taxes or subsidies), infrastructure improvement (e.g., road paving), and technological innovation (i.e., yield increases) on the spatial patterns of land-use conversions. Our model suggests future land-use change will mainly happen along intensification pathways, with deforestation slowing down, if land-use actors would be profit-maximizing. This general pattern did not change even for policy interventions that impacted profits from agriculture in major ways, cautioning against overestimating the leverage that economic policies provide for halting deforestation. Improving the region's road network would create a strong incentive to expand cropland further into remaining woodlands and over grazing lands. However, low agricultural profits and higher yields could curb deforestation in marginal areas to some extent. We also highlight that priority areas for conservation are particularly likely to experience high land-use pressure in the future. Given the lower-than-expected power of economic policies to alter deforestation patterns in our models, zoning, if properly enforced, appears to be a more straightforward tool for avoiding unwanted environmental impacts in the Chaco. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jamie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: chaco,argentina,socioeconomic",,

M W.S., Härtl F.H., Paul C., Knoke T.",,,,,"Diversified agricultural landscapes have been shown to provide a wide range of ecosystem services. It is often stated that the main motivation behind growing multiple crops within a farm is to buffer farm income against market and climate risks. However, household characteristics, particularly the amount of off-farm income may also influence farm diversity. While the drivers of diversifying farm income have been investigated extensively, the ecologically important level of land-use diversity on a farm has seldom been used as a dependent variable. Based on data from 163 households, this paper analyzes the impact of social, economic and demographic household characteristics on crop diversification for farms located around the Laipuna Reserve in the dry forests of southern Ecuador. Using a Heckman two-step regression model, we identified factors that influence a) the probability that a farm will be diversified (PD) and b) the degree of diversification at the farm level (LUD), quantified by the Shannon index. We found that PD is positively related to the percentage of household members who depend on family income but do not work (economic dependence ratio), as well as river access and available family labor force. PD is inversely related to access to financial support (i.e. social payments and credits) and off-farm income. LUD is positively related to the number of household members and the age of the head of the household, and correlates negatively with labor force, financial support and off-farm income. Our results demonstrate that land-use diversification is not only a strategy to reduce risk, but it is also driven by farmers’ efforts to meet household, mainly subsistence, needs. Moreover, we also demonstrate that when households have access to financial support and off-farm income, the pressure to diversify their crops diminishes. Finally, we argue that forest and agricultural policies should impose instruments to support land-use diversification financially, while acknowledging the importance of financial support and off-farm income for household economies. Strategies to reduce poverty should be accompanied by direct support of land-use diversification, infrastructure development and agricultural training. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jamie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: ecuador,croplands,socioeconomic",,

The planting of this native species can enhance the well-being of the ecosystem and establish future benefits for smallholdings. However, it is crucial that when taking up innovative practices to cope with environmental change, a willingness to apply them should be fostered among local farmers. We used constellation analysis as a transdisciplinary approach to identify elements of current land management which subsequently defined the nodes of a Bayesian network (BN). We developed probabilities of practice uptake that strengthen success, namely the conservation of natural resources while securing the incomes of smallholders. In collaboration with stakeholders and experts, 25 identified nodes for the BN were tested under various scenarios. Adopting all suggested innovative practices secures the final objectives—ecosystem health and farmer benefits (approx. 90%). The analysis quantified the relevance of single issues that may impede farmers to adopt the practices, such as having to cultivate seedlings or avoiding long-term investments. Further crucial actions include the fencing-off of livestock and marketing pathways. Affordable credit, research, and supportive farmers’ institutions can encourage farmers to implement innovative practices. The use of modeled scenarios can provide evidence, which might encourage sustainable land management. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jamie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: brazil,caatinga,actor focus",,
rayyan-339919025,"How may deforestation rates and political instruments affect land use patterns and Carbon emissions in the semi-arid Chaco, Argentina?",2020,1,1,,,99,,,"Baldassini P., Bagnato C.E., Paruelo J.M.",,,,,"In the last decades, dry Chaco forests experienced both intensive deforestation and land use changes. The intensification of deforestation at the national level led to the enactment of the National Forest Law (N° 26.331) in 2007. However, after its implementation, deforestation continued at high rates in explicitly protected areas (Categories I and II) in the provinces of Salta, Chaco and Santiago del Estero. In this article we estimated carbon (C) emission due to deforestation in a portion of the Argentine semi-arid Chaco (around 11 M ha) along 12 land use scenarios. A spatial model (InVEST) was used to prospectively analyze land use in the next 20 years, considering 4 levels of Forest Law compliance (denominated Current, Permissive, Partial and Strict) and 3 deforestation rates based on 2009-2015 records (denominated Expansion, Deceleration and Acceleration). We simulated the deforestation and its subsequent replacement by productive land uses (croplands, pastures and silvopastoral systems) based on a supervised land use classification for the year 2015. The C contents in different compartments (above and belowground biomass, litter and soil) were obtained from previous studies, based on a simulation model (CENTURY). The level of Forest Law compliance did not define the cleared area, except for those scenarios that considered a Strict compliance. Thus, productive land uses increased between 0.9 and 3.5 M ha after 20 years, depending on the deforestation rate. The total C emission was estimated between 51 and 169 Tg, where the burning of biomass and the decomposition of the remaining organic material represented about 96% of the emissions. Carbon changes in the upper 20 cm of the soil, represented a very low proportion of total emission. Although these estimations were conservative, given that not all sources have been considered, the study area showed a high potential contribution to the C emission at national scale. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jamie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: chaco,argentina",,

Understanding the effects of policy change on rates and locations of natural ecosystem loss is imperative. In this paper, deforestation in Minas Gerais was simulated annually until 2020 using Dinamica Environment for Geoprocessing Objects (Dinamica EGO). This system is a state-of-the-art land use and cover change (LUCC) model which incorporates government policy, landscape maps, and other biophysical and anthropogenic datasets. Three studied scenarios: (i) business as usual, (ii) increased deforestation, and (iii) decreased deforestation showed more transition to agriculture from shrubland compared to forests, and consistent locations for most deforestation. The probability of conversion to agriculture is strongly tied to areas with the smallest patches of original biome remaining. Increases in agricultural revenue are projected to continue with a loss of 25% of the remaining Cerrado land in the next decade if profit is maximized. The addition of biodiversity value as a tax on land sale prices, estimated at over $750,000,000 USD using the cost of extracting and maintaining current species ex-situ, can save more than 1 million hectares of shrubland with minimal effects on the economy of the State of Minas Gerais.

rayyan-339919034,Assessing and highlighting forest change in the tropics using multiscale data sets,2007,1,1,,,,,,"Eva H., Ashard F.",,,,,"For a number of years there has been a growing concern in the scientific community about the rapid changes in tropical forest ecosystems. The potential consequences of these changes with respect to carbon budgets and climate change (Detwiler and Hall 1988; Gash and Nobre 1996; Zhang, McGuffie, and Henderson-Sellers 1996; Melillo et al. 1996; Steudler et al. 1996), loss of habitat and fear of species extinction (Skole and Tucker 1993; Turner 1996; Prance and Elias 1976), and erosion of indigenous people's rights and ways of living (Vickers 1994; Redford and Padoch 1992), combined with concerns of resource mismanagement and depletion (Myers 1996), have drawn increased attention to the fate of tropical forest ecosystems. The scientific community has called for an intensive effort to highlight and document areas of rapid land-cover change (Turner et al. 1995). These concerns are reflected both in international conventions (IPCC 1996) and in bilateral government actions to reduce the impact of deforestation. The European Union has a stated policy of supporting sustainable forest management and therefore spends several hundred million euros on tropical forest initiatives each year (Shepherd et al. 1998). However, severe criticism has been leveled that aid funding has been counterproductive (Rainforest Foundation 1998), inasmuch as the perceived solutions for rural development are often at odds with forest conservation. One of the most striking examples of this is the extension and improvement of the road systems in the forest domain (FAO 1999; Laurance et al. 2001). In such circumstances, the provision of timely and accurate data on the tropical forest extent and its changes can help to formulate conservation policies and maximize their impact, and at the same time can serve as an important input into development planning. The Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, which has a mandate to collect and publish global forest statistics, would be in theory such a data source (FAO 2001); however, these data are often difficult to compare between countries due to different classification systems, are not spatially explicit, and in some cases are simply extrapolations of historical data (Matthews 2001). The Joint Research Center of the European Commission initiated the Tropical Ecosystem Environment Observation by Satellite (TREES) project in 1991 to develop a system for the monitoring of the extent, condition, and dynamics of the tropical forest belt at a global level. A crucial goal for the project was to develop techniques for highlighting areas undergoing rapid forest change so that appropriate political action and funding might be efficiently targeted (Malingreau et al. 1995). Over the last twenty years the use of observation satellites has become more commonplace as a remote sensing tool for documenting and estimating changes in land cover. The observations are carried out at different scales: There are fine spatial resolution observations from Landsat Thematic Mapper, for example, where a restricted scene of around 200 km width can be observed at a resolution of 30 m for a selected site once a month; there are also coarse spatial resolution observations from NOAA's advanced very high-resolution radiometer (AVHRR), where regional to continental scenes are acquired daily but with a poor spatial definition, at a resolution of about 1 km. While in theory a comprehensive coverage of the tropics using high spatial resolution data would reveal in detail the full extent of deforestation occurring at any one time, in practice the availability of imagery, the costs of acquisition and processing, and the huge amounts of data involved limit such efforts at global levels. The lack of sufficient imagery arises because cloud cover frequently obscures the target area in the tropics, and for a number of regions no ground stations exist, so that on-board satellite data storage is required. The latter depend on the space agencies, or on a paying customer. Coarse spatial resolution remote sensing data have the advantage of giving daily synoptic views over large, often inaccessible areas, allowing phenological analysis of the data. In many cases, near real-time data can be obtained, either through a local receiving station or through the space agencies via the World Wide Web. On the other hand, these data do not have sufficient spatial resolution to determine land-cover area change estimates accurately. In this chapter we describe the methods used to highlight areas of land-cover change in the humid forests of tropical South America, which contains about half of the world's remaining rainforest (Achard et al. 2002). Our objective was to use regional maps of forest cover and fire incidence, both derived from coarse resolution satellite data, in conjunction with expert opinion to highlight the major deforestation fronts in tropical South America. The resulting maps can be used to target projects aimed at supporting sustainable forest management accurately, to support public administration, to monitor the integrity of national parks and indigenous lands, and to focus studies that aim to measure forest change in these ""hotspots."" Our study encompasses the humid tropical forests of South America, which stretch from the Darien Gap in northwestern Colombia down the Choco, and across the Orinoco basin and Amazonian basins to the Guyanas (figure 24.1). On its eastern and southern edge the forest is bordered by the Brazilian cerrado and the Bolivian chaco, originally areas of dry forest and savanna, now predominantly agricultural. South of the equator, the western edge of the forest is delimited by the Andes mountain range. Within the vast humid forest domain of South America several large savannahs exist, notably the llanos of Colombia and Venezuela, the llanos de Mojos of Bolivia, and the Rio Branco/Rupunumi/Gran Sabana on the frontier of Brazil, Guyana, and Venezuela. While much of the area of dry forest had been exploited and converted to agriculture in colonial times, the humid forest areas have remained intact until the post-World War II period. Since then, major land-use changes have occurred due to economic growth and outmigration. The latter has arisen for a number of reasons: Isolation from markets and employment opportunities, lack of cultivable land, drought and civil disturbances, and few opportunities for producing cash crops (Preston 1996). The main migratory trends into the forest frontiers have been from the northeast of Brazil and from the Andes. In a number of countries the process has been encouraged by government grants, subsidies, and infrastructure improvements (Fearnside 1983; Nepstad et al. 1997). General economic growth at the national level has also stimulated these infrastructure improvements, leading to the construction and upgrading of ports and roads as well as increased mineral exploration and exploitation, all of which combine to make easier access to-and export from-the forested regions. The FAO forest area statistics show that the annual average net change rate for tropical South America between 1990 and 2000 was of the order of 0.4 percent; however, the data are not specifically spatially located, remaining aggregated at the country level (FAO 2001). There is a need therefore to provide decision makers with explicit information as to just where deforestation is occurring, along with comparative rates for the particular hotspots. © 2007 by the University of New Mexico Press.

Urbanisation induces land use and land cover (LULC) changes in the city and its hinterland affecting the region's climate and biodiversity. This paper aims to identify the trends of land use and land cover changes in the hinterland of Barranquilla corresponding to 13 municipalities in the north of the Department Atlántico. Landsat TM/ETM/OLI imagery from 1985 to 2017 was used to map and analyse the spatio-temporal development of land use and land cover changes. During the investigation period, the settlement areas grew by approximately 50% (from 103.3 to 153.6 km 2 ), while areas with woody vegetation cover experienced dynamic changes and increased in size since 2001. Peri-urban and rural areas were characterized by highly dynamic changes, particularly regarding clearing and recovery of vegetated areas. Regression analyses were performed to identify the impact factors of detected vegetation cover changes. Computed logistic regression models included 20 independent variables, such as relief, climate, soil, proximity characteristics and socio-economic data. The results of this study may act as a basis to enable researchers and decision-makers to focus on the most important signals of systematic landscape transformations and on the conservation of ecosystems and the services they provide. © 2018 by the authors.

Jaguars (Panthera onca) and pumas (Puma concolor) coexist with livestock in much of their range and have been historically blamed for livestock predation. At present, livestock landscapes are increasing, enlarging the conflict scenario where local perceptions are vital to understand the context in which the conflict emerges and data of livestock predation become an effective tool to plunge into it. We assess local perceptions about felids and identify the bases of the conflict in the Bolivian Pantanal and dry forest ecoregions using livestock predation data. We interviewed local ranchers and crossed information with the governmental livestock database achieving a comprehensive study on the conflict, based on descriptive statistics for local perceptions and generalized linear mixed models for analyzing cattle predation by felids. The conflict appeared to be widespread since most ranchers suffered predation on cattle, especially in the Pantanal. Annual cattle loss is generally low (1.8%) with some exceptions that may magnify the generalized negative perception towards felids. Factors related to cattle management practices explained better felid predation on livestock rather than habitat quality of the ranch or ranchers’ attitude towards felids. We recommend local administrations to recover livestock predation data and to highlight the importance that husbandry practices may have to reduce cattle losses by felids. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jamie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: bolivia,ranching context",,
rayyan-339919063,Making tropical agriculture more Sustainable by using bioeconomic models,2007,1,1,,,,,,"Barbier B., Deybe D., Alary V., Carpentier C.L.",,,,,"Small farmers from the tropics are struggling to sustain their livelihoods while the world's natural and policy environment is changing. Trade liberalization affects many of these farmers differently- often negatively when subsidies and protections are removed, sometimes under the direction of ""structural adjustment"" programs of, for example, the IMF or the World Bank; in some cases positively when previous policies were biased against agriculture and when a freer access to market expands opportunities. Looking beyond short-term profits, the question of whether the new policies induce more sustainable production systems is still quite ambiguous. Small farmers are also struggling to adopt new technologies. There seemingly is a large variety of technologies available, but adoption is still low among small farmers from tropical countries. What type of policies and what type of technologies can help improve productivity of poor farmers while maintaining the resource base? To what degree do these new technologies make small farmers beholden to debt, the industrialized countries, and the probable future increases in the price of petroleum and its products? To answer these questions, one has to study farming systems in some detail and make some predictions about how these systems will respond, change, and adapt to external incentives while population is increasing rapidly even as natural resources are under increasing pressure. Teams of economists and agriculturalists join their expertise to link farming system analysis and natural resources processes with human behavioral models to simulate the dynamics of the farming systems under various scenarios. In this chapter we present a few applications of these bioeconomic models to address the impacts of increasing population pressure, increasing access to markets, and external incentives related to welfare and natural resources management. What are the relations between these factors and environmental degradation? What are the policy and technical options to make these systems more sustainable? In the first part of the chapter, we present the tropical agroecosystems that we studied. In the second, we review the use of bioeconomic models in agriculture. In the third we describe a few applications, and in the last part we present overall results and conclusions. The Tropical Agroecosystems Studied Tropical small-scale farming systems are numerous and diverse but can be categorized according to a gradient of management intensity from slash-andburn to permanent agriculture (Ruthenberg 1980). In this chapter we analyze and compare the fallow systems from the savanna of West Africa, the forest systems of the hillsides of Central America, the rancher system of the humid forest margin of Amazonia in Brazil, and the permanent intensive systems of the subhumid Gangetic Plain of northern India as representative of this gradient of intensification. In West Africa, increasing population pressure on land should lead, at least according to the Boserup school of thought, to labor and capital intensification and to the adoption of new technologies (Boserup 1965; see chapter 12). Instead, we observe migrations either to less-populated rural areas or to overcrowded cities. Trade liberalization of the mid-1990s was supposed to free farmers from an ""inefficient"" state, but while the devaluation of an overvalued currency had a positive impact, privatization led to market failures and too often the destruction of these farmers' way of subsistence. The three African villages studied, located on a north-south transect representing a gradient of increasing rainfall, are typical of their climatic conditions. The Sahelian village of Banizoumbou in Niger (ILRI dataset 1998) was used to predict the future of transhumance in the Sahel (Barbier and Hazell 2000). Increasing population pressure and expansion of cropland makes the traditional transhumance migrations of cattle and sheep from north to south more difficult every year. While most ""experts"" believe that nomadism has no future, a recent school of thought argues that it is the most suitable human activity for the Sahelian ecosystem (Scoones 1996). The other semiarid village, Kolbila on the Mossi Plateau of Burkina Faso (ICRISAT dataset), is less arid but is located in a much more densely populated region. Agriculture is the main activity, but its sustainability is at risk because of declining biomass and soil fertility. The village of Bala, located in the cotton-producing area of Burkina Faso (CIRAD dataset), is in a more humid region. It is less populated at present, but immigration from the north is increasing population pressure, which induces a shift from slash-andburn to a more intensive but not yet sustainable system (Barbier and BenoÎt-Cattin 1997). In Central America, we analyzed the situation of the communities on the hillsides of Honduras. In addition to being the second-poorest country of the American continent after Haiti, Honduras was hit by a hurricane in 1999, which destroyed a large part of its infrastructure and showed as well how poor management of its upper watersheds has made its valleys vulnerable to floods and landslides. Most of the fertile lowland valleys are used for extensive large-scale ranching, while small farmers struggle on the steep hillsides where the topsoil is eroding rapidly. The five Honduran watersheds where we applied bioeconomic models represent contrasting pathways of development. Farmers in the Lalima watershed follow a vegetable production pathway, producing principally a large range of vegetables. Overdrafting of the river by irrigation reduces water availability during the dry season (Barbier and Bergeron 1999). The San Nicolas watershed has become an intensive coffee production and processing area, which generates extremely high levels of water contamination that in turn affect many downstream communities (Barbier et al. 2003). The Río Calán watershed produces vegetables and coffee and supplies water to the downstream city of Siguatapeque and to a large hydroelectric dam (Jimenez et al. 2000). In the Jalapa watershed, farmers produce on steep slopes prone to rapid erosion and are part of the El Cajón watershed, which drains into a dam that generates 60 percent of the electricity used in Honduras (Hernández 2002:642). In the Choluteca watershed, widespread grain production on slopes threatens the sustainability of the shrimp industry downstream in the mangroves of the Golfo de Fonseca (Hernández et al. 2002). The large charge of sediment in the water makes shrimp production much more expensive (Samayoa 2000:647). In these watersheds, the ""pathway of development"" type applied by the population has been explained as principally a function of exogenous factors such as agroclimatic conditions, availability of spring water, and access to markets (Pender et al. 1999). The two watersheds that were well connected to markets have progressively expanded their vegetable production. Those located farther from a good paved road or major city have focused on coffee where rainfall is generous and on basic grain if the climate is drier. In Brazil, the Amazonian forest continues to shrink progressively under pressure from loggers followed by small farmers and finally ranchers. In some areas the Brazilian government is trying to prevent farmers from clearing more forest by allocating plots of a few dozen hectares of forest margin to families, under the condition that they will stay within these boundaries and clear only half of their holdings. One such settlement project takes place on the western southern border of the Amazonian forest (IFPRI dataset) in the regionsof Rondonia. The objective of the study was to identify the second-best alternative to slash-andburn (Carpentier et al. 1999). Is it coffee, timber production, forest products extraction, food crop, cattle ranching, or carbon sequestration? The model was supposed to verify if the new systems are economical and environmentally sustainable. The Indian study is set in Haryana state in northern India, one of the most productive states of India, and also one of the most populated. In the 1960s and 1970s the green revolution, based on improved germ plasm, chemical fertilizers, and irrigation, transformed the state into a massive producer of rice and wheat. The adoption of new techniques was helped by heavy governmental subsidies to reduce input price and stabilize output prices especially for wheat and rice (Aggarwal et al. 2000; Dorin and Landy 2002). Now that the Indian government is trying to cut subsidies to the agricultural sector, some fear that Haryana's grain production will stagnate. Now that the government wants to reduce subsidies for water and electricity, one has to assess the likely impact on production, poverty, and the environment (Alary 2002:645). Overall, the comparative study given in this chapter includes nine farming systems in four ecoregions of five countries (tables 31.1-31.3). All except the Indian example are small-scale, semicommercialized farming systems integrating crop and livestock, using mainly hand tools with little mechanization and irrigation. They are all increasingly integrated to the market, but population pressures and resource degradation are at play. © 2007 by the University of New Mexico Press.

Subsistance farmers use this dry forest to raise goats and cattle and to obtain a broad range of goods and services. Thus, two very different and non-compatible land uses are in dispute. On the one hand subsistance farmers fostering an extensive and diversified forest use, on the other hand, large-scale producers who need to clear out the forest to sow annual crops in order to appropriate soil fertility. First, the paper looks at how these social actors perceive Chaco forest, what their interests are, and what kind of values they attach to it. Second, we analyze the social-environmental conflicts that arise among actors in order to appropriate forest's benefits. Special attention is paid to the role played by the government in relation to: (a) how does it respond to the demands of the different sectors; and (b) how it deals with the management recommendations produced by scientists carrying out social and ecological research. To put these ideas at test we focus on a case study located in Western Córdoba (Argentina), where industrial agriculture is expanding at a fast pace, and where social actors' interests are generating a series of disputes and conflicts. Drawing upon field work, the paper shows how power alliances between economic and political powers, use the institutional framework of the State in their own benefit, disregarding wider environmental and social costs. © 2018 by the Regents of the University of California.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jamie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: chaco,context,argentina",,

The spatial distribution of land cover changes was related to environmental and socio-economic variables. The overall land cover change pattern of ""periurban forest transition"" was characterized by urban expansion, agriculture adjustment and associated forest recovery. Montane forests showed a net increase of 10%, expanding over mountain grasslands, which in turn lost 66% of their original area. Dry forests experienced high levels of swaps, being relocated into more humid areas and further away from access roads. Simultaneously, herbaceous agriculture was concentrated in flat areas more suitable for modern mechanized agriculture. In the foothills of the San Javier range, urban areas tripled their original extension replacing fertile agricultural lands (mainly sugar cane). Forest recovery and land-use intensification patterns are usually considered as an opportunity for conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services. However, these new forests are characterized by the abundance of exotic species with little known ecological properties. Also, the replacement of highly productive agriculture by urban developments, and of natural montane grasslands by forests, imply negative changes in terms of agriculture production, the conservation of grassland biodiversity and landscape configuration with high recreational value. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jamie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: argentina,land use pathways",,

In the last 35 years, more than 50% of its approximately 2 million km2 has been transformed into pasture and agricultural lands planted in cash crops. The Cerrado has the richest flora among the world's savannas (&gt;7000 species) and high levels of endemism. Species richness of birds, fishes, reptiles, amphibians, and insects is equally high, whereas mammal diversity is relatively low. Deforestation rates have been higher in the Cerrado than in the Amazon rainforest, and conservation efforts have been modest: only 2.2% of its area is under legal protection. Numerous animal and plant species are threatened with extinction, and an estimated 20% of threatened and endemic species do not occur in protected areas. Soil erosion, the degradation of the diverse Cerrado vegetation formations, and the spread of exotic grasses are widespread and major threats. The use of fire for clearing land and to encourage new growth for pasture has also caused damage, even though the Cerrado is afire-adapted ecosystem. Ecosystem experiments and modeling show that change in land cover is altering the hydrology and affecting carbon stocks and fluxes. Cerrado agriculture is lucrative, and agricultural expansion is expected to continue, requiring improvements in and extension of the transportation infrastructure, which will affect not only the Cerrado but also the Amazon forest. Large-scale landscape modification and threats to numerous species have led to renewed interest from various sectors in promoting the conservation of the Cerrado, particularly through strengthening and enlarging the system of protected areas and improving farming practices and thus the livelihoods of local communities.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jamie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: brazil,cerrado",,

In the ∼2 million km 2 Brazilian cerrado biome, a global biodiversity hotspot, vast areas have been converted into croplands and cattle pastures. Because the cerrado biome is overwhelmingly contained within private lands, Brazil's environmental legislation should serve as a decisive instrument in protecting these natural ecosystems. We assessed the role of Legal Reserves (LRs), legally defined as the minimum proportion of private landholdings set aside to protect natural vegetation, in the conservation of the cerrado biome. We assume that the property-scale allocation of LRs is primarily based on economic decision-making, creating a bias against cerrado protection. We therefore assessed the area ratio between forest vegetation (FV) and grassland vegetation (GV) areas across LRs within 48,762 landholdings, 9 formal protected areas (PAs) and 34 Indigenous Lands (ILs) within the cerrado (sensu lato) of the 903,357-km 2 state of Mato Grosso, Brazil. We show that there are 7.26 ha of forest lands for each hectare of native grasslands within private RLs of the cerrado biome within Mato Grosso, a ratio almost three-fold larger than that found in formal PAs and ILs. ILs protect in absolute values (hectares) six-fold more native grassland vegetation than PAs. We discuss the policy relevance of this severe land-use bias in maintaining the heterogeneity of cerrado habitats for biodiversity conservation within private properties, which account for 90% of the entire cerrado biome. © 2018 Associação Brasileira de Ciência Ecológica e Conservação","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jamie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: brazil,policy,cerrado,political ecology",,

In the last four decades, however, the natural herbaceous vegetation with low nutrient requirements in the savannahs (llanos) of Colombia and Venezuela, as well as in the Cerrado (Brazil) has been replaced by introduced African pastures, particularly from the genera Brachiaria and Andropogon. Furthermore, intensive reforestation programs for timber and pulpwood commercialization have introduced species able to cope with the environmental conditions, such as Pinus and Eucaliptus. The introduction of African pastures and annual and perennial crops has been possible with fertilization (N, P, K and lime). The landscape modifications caused by these land uses are usually far from the urban areas and are still considered to be low. However, if the entire land surface currently affected by agriculture and agroforestry use and the land yet to be incorporated into projects is taken into consideration, a profound modification is expected to occur in these biomes. Herein is presented a preliminary comparative review of the agricultural colonization processes in the Llanos and Cerrados. In the need to generate indicators related to biogeochemical processes, three case studies from Venezuelan savannahs are presented.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jamie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: brazil,guyana,llanos,cerrado,context,history,orinoco,colombia,Venezuela",,

The most dramatic land cover and land use (LCLU) changes began in the early 1970s with the establishment of the Trans-Amazon Highway and large government projects associated with the expansion of agricultural settlement and cattle ranching, which cleared significant tropical forest cover in the areas of new and accelerated human development. Taking the changes in the LCLU over the past four decades as a basis, this study aims to determine the consequences of land cover (forest and savanna) and land use (pasturelands, mining and urban) changes on the hydroclimatology of the Itacaiúnas River watershed area of the located in the southeastern Amazon region. We analyzed a multi-decadal Landsat dataset from 1973, 1984, 1994, 2004 and 2013 and a 40-yr time series of water discharge from the Itacaiúnas River, as well as air temperature and relative humidity data over this drainage area for the same period. We employed standard Landsat image processing techniques in conjunction with a geographic object-based image analysis and multi-resolution classification approach. With the goal of detecting possible long-term trends, non-parametric Mann-Kendall test was applied, based on a Sen slope estimator on a 40-yr annual PREC, TMED and RH time series, considering the spatial average of the entire watershed. In the 1970s, the region was entirely covered by forest (99%) and savanna (~0.3%). Four decades later, only ~48% of the tropical forest remains, while pasturelands occupy approximately 50% of the watershed area. Moreover, in protected areas, nearly 97% of the tropical forest remains conserved, while the forest cover of non-protected areas is quite fragmented and, consequently, unevenly distributed, covering an area of only 30%. Based on observational data analysis, there is evidence that the conversion of forest cover to extensive and homogeneous pasturelands was accompanied by systematic modifications to the hydroclimatology cycle of the Itacaiúnas watershed, thus highlighting drier environmental conditions due to a rise in the region's air temperature, a decrease in the relative humidity, and an increase in river discharge. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jamie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: brazil,land use pathways",,

The conservation strategy employed by the Kayapó Indians of the Brazilian Amazon is taken as an exemplary model. It interlinks forest and agriculture as poles of a classification continuum that focuses on useful Non-Domesticated Resources (NDRs) found in transitional anthropogenic ecosystems, such as savanna 'forest islands', forest openings and old agricultural fields. Kayapó TEK has applications for Amazonia and beyond, but equitable utilisation of indigenous knowledge and management models requires guarantees of basic human rights for indigenous and traditional peoples. This includes protection of knowledge and genetic resources, as well as adequate benefit-sharing from their use.

Although data is scarce, one can conclude that the impacts of humans on the environment have varied in time and space in quite intricate ways. Hunting has affected, and continues affecting, basically the whole study area, but it is now more concentrated in space than what it has probably ever been before. Also forest clearing has become more concentrated in space but, in addition, it has gone from affecting only hilltops forests to affecting alluvial plains as well as hilltops and, lately, also the slopes of the hills.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jamie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: ecuador",,

Since 1985, pastures and croplands have replaced nearly 65 Mha of forests and savannas in the legal Amazon. A growing body of work suggests that this paradigm of horizontal expansion of agriculture over ecosystems is outdated and brings negative social and environmental outcomes. Here we propose four strategies that can reduce deforestation, while increasing production and social wellbeing. First, eliminate land grabbing and land speculation through designation of public forests. This would clarify land tenure and limit the pool of land available for uncontrolled expansion of agriculture and ranching. Second, reduce deforestation on private properties by implementing existing mechanisms in Brazil's Forest Code to facilitate payments for environmental services, with support from market initiatives for sustainable sourcing of agricultural products. Third, incentivize increased productivity on medium and large properties through targeted investments. By stimulating adoption of proven technologies for sustainable intensification, this would help meet Brazil's production targets and growing international demand for agricultural products, without expanding into new production areas. Finally, foster economic, environmental and social improvements through technical assistance to small farmers. Small farmers occupy a large swath of the Amazon and often lack access to technical assistance, production technology, and markets. Providing quality technical assistance to small farmers could help them better align production practices with local opportunities; increase household income and improve livelihoods; and reduce deforestation pressure. By implementing these four strategies in a coordinated effort between public and private agents, Brazil can show the world how to reduce deforestation while increasing agricultural output, reestablishing its leadership in managing natural resources and mitigating climate change. © 2019 The Authors","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jamie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: brazil",,

Here, we evaluated farm compliance with the Brazilian Forest Code (revised in 2012) in Mato Grosso do Sul state, where agribusiness activities have already converted more than 70% of native vegetation, Cerrado. We analysed the most recent version of the CAR dataset, using geographic information system analytical tools. We observed a positive relationship between compliance with the 20% compulsory Legal Reserves and farm size class. We showed that larger, rather than smaller, farms have important effects on biodiversity conservation at the landscape scale. Large farms (> than 1000 ha), comprising 74.2% of the study area, tended to show better compliance levels (51%) than smaller properties (33%). At the same time, they contain huge amount of land with native vegetation that lies outside Legal Reserves, and so may pose a risk for legal deforestation of near 2 million ha. We argue that a portfolio of socioeconomic incentives for restoration, protected areas, and no-net-loss components in agricultural programmes, are essential measures to increase compliance and halt deforestation in the Cerrado of Central Brazil. Moreover, we argue that considering property size improves the likelihood of success of such initiatives. Although acknowledging that landscape management can help address socioeconomic conflicts and improve food production, it must be accompanied by a strong “anti-deforestation” policy to guarantee the maintenance of existing native vegetation remnants. We also highlight the importance of investigating the role of property size in maintaining remaining vegetation in this region, instead of merely focused on the number of compliant farms. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jamie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: brazil,cerrado,property,socioeconomic",,

Based on the estimates of soil loss in 140,297km2 pasturelands of Goiás State and the Federal District, the effects of land use and management and conservation practices on soil erosion by water were evaluated. Soil loss was estimated with the empirical revised universal soil loss equation model under four scenarios of land use and management of pastures and the implementation of terraces. The effects of converting hilly areas into permanently preserved areas were also evaluated. Well-managed pastures planted in terraces and highly sloped areas with native vegetation featured a reduction of 709% in the rate of soil erosion by water in comparison with poorly managed pastures without soil conservation practices. The environmental consequences of pasture degradation become particularly important when they are associated with land use in the Amazon and Cerrado biomes because farmers in these regions are forced to open new natural areas. In addition, the high indices of bare soil in degraded pastures contribute significantly to sediment deposition in rivers and dams. The modeling of soil loss is demonstrated to be an important tool for land use planning and supporting public policies focused on the sustainable use of natural resources.

The government claims that a new national land registry (SICAR), introduced under the revised law, could end illegal deforestation by greatly reducing the cost of monitoring, enforcement, and compliance. This study evaluates that potential, using data from state-level land registries (CAR) in Pará and Mato Grosso that were precursors of SICAR. Using geospatial analyses and stakeholder interviews, we quantify the impact of CAR on deforestation and forest restoration, investigating how landowners adjust their behaviors over time. Our results indicate rapid adoption of CAR, with registered properties covering a total of 57 Mha by 2013. This suggests that the financial incentives to join CAR currently exceed the costs. Registered properties initially showed lower deforestation rates than unregistered ones, but these differences varied by property size and diminished over time. Moreover, only 6% of registered producers reported taking steps to restore illegally cleared areas on their properties. Our results suggest that, from the landowner’s perspective, full compliance with the Forest Code offers few economic benefits. Achieving zero illegal deforestation in this context would require the private sector to include full compliance as a market criterion, while state and federal governments develop SICAR as a de facto enforcement mechanism. These results are relevant to other tropical countries and underscore the importance of developing a policy mix that creates lasting incentives for sustainable land-use practices. © 2017, National Academy of Sciences.

Although the effects of deforestation are well known, the understanding of its drives at regional levels is incipient. Most studies consider that a driver influences deforestation likewise in all regions. However, deforestation has a strong spatial structure that can lead drivers to vary their influence on deforestation in different regions. Here, we evaluated the spatial variability in the relationship between the recent Cerrado deforestation and socioeconomic, environmental, and structural drivers at a regional scale. We used a geographically weighted regression (GWR) to assess the spatial variability of predictor variables. We identified regions that respond similarly to the drivers by grouping municipalities, considering their GWR coefficients through hierarchical clustering. The analyses that consider the spatial variability of predictors are more appropriated to assess the causes of recent deforestation. Remnant natural vegetation influenced the recent deforestation in all defined regions. Greater access to rural credit concession was the main driving force of deforestation in the northeast region defined here. Distance to roads increased deforestation in the northeast and north regions, while it inhibited deforestation in the central-east and southeast regions. Rainfall inhibited deforestation in the northeast, north, and southwest regions. Steep slope prevented deforestation mainly in the northeast, north, and southwest regions.

Questions of soils research have become particularly significant for understanding the forms of landscape manipulations that could have given rise to large pre-Columbian populations in tropical forest areas, and their implications for sustainable practices today, especially in light of deter-minist theories that viewed the possibilities of Amazonian cultural evolution as constrained by the general poverty of its upland soils (Denevan 2001; Erickson 2000; Heckenberger et al. 2003; Kim et al. 2007; Lehmann 2003; Peterson et al. 2001). The analyses of indigenous tropical savanna management, and especially of soils on the other hand, are relatively rare. In part this reflects the reality that savanna peoples are also often managers of forests, since savanna ecosystems are usually part of ecotones that include gallery forests and a complex mosaic of lower biomass, semi-deciduous forests and successional systems as well as the open woodlands. Researchers often laid the emphasis on the forest rather than the Cerrado side of the equation, because they themselves were often more interested in the agricultural bases of these societies (Gross, Hames). For funding, it was often convenient to portray such heterodox groups as forest dwellers, or ambiguously as native Amazonians since such an approach fit in with broader social and scientific concerns about tropical environments and human rights alarms over Amazonian development. © Springer Science + Business Media B.V. 2009.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jamie""=>""Included""}",,

These areas have been significantly deforested over the last 50 years due to public policies and land privatization aiming at economic development, agricultural and agribusiness expansion in Central and Amazonian Brazil. These political and economic drivers contributed to the conversion of five million hectares of Seasonal Evergreen Forests and Cerrados (Brazilian savanna) into agricultural land. In order to reverse the damaging trends of the future of the Xingu River and promote common benefits to indigenous and non-indigenous peoples, the Campaign fostered the creation of the Xingu Seed Network to promote exchange and commercialization of native seeds demanded by farmers and landholders for planting and restoring permanent preservation areas, such as riparian forests, and vegetation associated with lakes and springs of the Suiá-Miçu River Basin. The aim of this study is to examine the role played by the 'Y Ikatu Campaign in the conservation of these common-pool resources – Xingu's headwaters, riparian forests and rivers–and in mobilizing heterogeneous social groups living in this region to engage in the protection of the watershed.

rayyan-339919256,"Economie, social and ecological impacts on Brazil of accelerated liberalisation of the European sugar market",2007,1,1,,,59,11,,[No author name available],,,,,"With 5 million hectares of cropping land, Brazil is the biggest producer of sugarcane the world over. More than half of the sugarcane produced is currently being turned into ethanol to fuel vehicles on the domestic market. The dual structure of the sugarcane and alcohol processing industry means that Brazil is able to react flexibly to developments in prices and is therefore one of the leading players on the world market. Brazil has a strong domestic market for sugar; however, the share of exports continually increased in the nineties. In 2000 Brazil produced 9.45 million tonnes of sugar for the domestic market and 7.7 million tonnes for the export market, equivalent to 25 per cent of total world sugar exports. At an average of US$200 per tonne, Brazil has the lowest production costs worldwide. Modern, export-oriented firms even manage to produce at a rate of US$160 per tonne. Should all the market restrictions be lifted, Brazil would be able to meet Europe's entire demand for imported sugar. However, the impacts this would have are seen in a different light in the various key cultivation areas within Brazil: In southern parts of Brazil, the state-promoted production of alcohol fuel through the PROALCOOL (Pro-alcohol) programme in the seventies led to the creation of the world's largest sugarcane cultivation area. In a bid to promote sugar exports, enormous investment has been undertaken since the mid-1990s in transport infrastructure and in agro-sector modernisation, making this sector one of the most efficient in the world today. Also, enterprises are now merging with the support of international capital. The relaunch of the PROALCOOL programme, along with rising domestic demand in Brazil's industrial centres, mean that the domestic market still has a pivotal role to play in Brazil's economic future. Although the social status quo in these enterprises has improved, mechanisation in the agricultural sector will ultimately lead to job losses for hundreds of thousands of rural workers. Until now there have been no measures designed to cope with the resulting social problems. Technological advances have been achieved in environmental protection, but the concept of ecologically harmful monocultures based on ""latifundios"" or large-scale land owners and land concentration remains the same. Owing to the influence of the domestic market in southern parts of Brazil, it is to be expected that expanding sugar production in response to additional export requirements following the liberalisation of the European market will essentially be found in the Midwest and Minas Gerais where modern structures are being built up as well. The extension of arable land here will be in the severely threatened Cerrado ecological system (tree savannah), known as the breadbasket of Brazil. Furthermore, bodies of surface water and thus the Panatal and other wetland areas will bear the brunt of agro-chemicals and sedimentation. The spin-off effects of sugarcane plantations in terms of employment are so slight that the local population will be forced to move to other regions, thereby exerting more pressure on regions that are as yet without human settlements, such as the fringe of the Amazon basin. Owing to its topography, antiquated production structures and the very inflexible oligarchy of sugar producers, Brazil's Northeast, homeland of the Brazilian sugar industry, will only be marginally competitive in comparison with other parts of Brazil. Many production plants and arable farms have closed down in recent years. Indeed, the region now has the lowest social standards in the whole of Brazil. NGOs perceive this crisis as an opportunity to decrease the region's dependency on the sugarcane industry and to reduce land concentration. A renaissance of the sugar industry under present framework conditions would, however, run counter to ongoing efforts to introduce agricultural reform, establish more differentiated economic structures and reafforest the Mata Atlântica. It can be said of all regions that a rapid as well as a gradual opening up of the European sugar market will promote a non-sustainable model of agricultural economics that would lead to economic growth but would offer virtually no solutions to the ecological and social problems it would bring with it. At the international level, gradual liberalisation could give ACP states the scope they need to catch up technologically and thus become more competitive towards Brazil. However, in these countries too, the question remains as to whether the industrial agricultural economy will meet these countries' ecological and social needs. As far as the negotiations for new sugar market regulations are concerned, it has to be emphasised that the WTO does not have a mandate for ecological and social issues, although its regulations and policies have enormous implications in this regard. Attention should be drawn here to the respective responsibilities of other international institutions whose legal mandates even contradict each other (inter alia ILO and Agenda 21). Brazil has signed many international treaties and conventions and is therefore bound to their implementation. The Brazilian legal code already offers instruments for implementing these treaties, whereby emphasis is to be placed on the following: Brazil is a signatory state to the UN Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Human Rights. In sugar cultivation areas, basic human rights such as the right to adequate food and the right to health are being violated. The extension of arable areas frequently contravenes conventions designed to protect indigenous peoples. Some ILO regulations have already been introduced into labour law and into trade union conventions. However, informal employer-employee relationships and social grievances are still widespread. The provisions of various environmental conventions (conventions on biodiversity and climate change etc.) have to be implemented on the national level; however, they hardly feature at all in the extension of arable land. At the national level, implementation of the conventions can be made more effective through the following measures: Brazil already has well-defined environmental and social legislation which, however, is largely ignored in the sugar and alcohol industries. The Brazilian government should therefore strengthen agencies and bodies responsible for controlling enterprises. Besides measures in the field of environmental technology, the extension of crop areas calls for an assessment of both environmental and social impacts which should contain viable participatory strategies for solving the problems of the population groups affected and for protecting ecologically sensitive areas. State programmes should be directed towards decentralised agricultural development in support of small farmers. Implementation of agrarian reform as a basic condition for combating rural poverty along with the implementation of the human right to adequate food should be promoted without delay. International trading partners should support Brazil, for example, via the pilot project for the protection of Brazilian tropical forests (PPG7). It should, however, be pointed out that European sugar-beet production is not ecologically sustainable either and only has marginal impacts on employment. Ecologically sound and decentralised agriculture is therefore needed in Europe too, especially in view of its eastward extension. Hence, the restructuring of the sugar industry is a project that concerns the entire global community and one which demands changes on the part of all actors involved.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jamie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: brazil,context,economic context",,
rayyan-339919258,The use of fire in the cerrado and Amazonian rainforests of Brazil: Past and present,2011,1,1,,,7,1,,Pivello V.R.,,,,,"Humans have been changing the natural fire regimes in most Brazilian vegetation types for over 4000 years. Natural lightning fires can easily happen in savannas and grasslands, but they are rare in the moist rainforests. Today, anthropogenic fires are frequent in both the fire-adapted cerrado (Brazilian savanna) and the fire-sensitive rainforest. In this paper, I compare two very different biomes concerning their susceptibilities and responses to fire: the Amazon rainforest and the cerrado. I present an overview of their fire history, especially regarding human-made fires for land management, and pull together information about the use of fire by indigenous peoples in the cerrado and the Amazon, as this information is very fragmented. Accordingly, I describe how fire regimes have changed in these biomes over time due to agricultural practices and the consequences of the current altered fire regimes. After European settlement, fire frequency greatly increased in the cerrado, especially related to cattle ranching, and more recently in the more seasonal landscapes in the Amazon. In cerrado natural preserves, however, managers try to keep fire away, but wildfires eventually come and develop into destructive events. Actions to reduce biodiversity loss and environmental deterioration due to inappropriate fire management are necessary and should be very distinct in both areas: in the Amazon they would include the development of policies to stimulate fire-free, small-scale agricultural projects, and in the cerrado, sustainable use of fire for cattle ranching is possible but the regimes must be fitted to local specific features in order to avoid land degradation. In cerrado conservation areas, proper fire management programs based on scientific knowledge and the incorporation of the traditional expertise of indigenous peoples are needed to maintain the biological diversity, to maintain the ecological processes, and to reduce wildfires.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jamie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: brazil,cerrado",,

To meet the growing demand for animal products, silvopastoral systems (SPS) can be an alternative as they have greater biodiversity and offer more environmental services than conventional cattle ranching systems. This paper aims to describe the implementation of SPS by traditional farmers in a rural settlement in southeastern Brazil, and the impacts on biodiversity of native plants. SPS were implemented by farmers in three selected areas that were cleared with a tractor. The impacts on the community and populations of native plants were estimated through vegetation sampling before and after the implementation of the SPS. Direct observations and semi-structured interviews were conducted to describe the implementation of the system and to understand the criteria employed to spare species, to manage native plants and the advantages of these systems according to farmers’ perceptions. Before the implementation, 1038 trees from 50 species and 29 botanical families were surveyed in the three areas. The tractor cleared on average 72 % of the trees, decreasing the number of trees ha−1 from 692 to 180 and reducing tree richness in 43 %. On average, 89 % of the removed trees had diameter ranging from 5 to 10 cm, indicating farmers’ preference in sparing the thickest trees. Farmers also spare useful species that have socio-economic importance, such as timber, fruit trees, fodder and medicine. According to the farmers, the advantages of the SPS are the high concentration of useful species, the environmental services provided and the increase in livestock production. The system described has great potential to ensure food security, generating socio-economic benefits for farmers and contributing to biodiversity conservation. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jamie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: brazil,southeastern",,

In following this stody, the focus must be on the dynamics of the developmental process as it evolved worldwide during this period. In the capitalist economy that has dominated much of global development over the past two centuries, extensive occupation and economic development of remote frontier regions invariably depended upon political, economic, and cultural forces centered elsewhere, although often with the cooperation of local interests. This dynamic of market demand and linked political institutions was a determining factor in the settlement of the western United States, and it played the same role in the Brazilian savanna, above all in terms of the expansion of the ranching regime and subsequent agribusiness. While the size of the cerrado precludes uniformity of environmental conditions, common elements do exist that permit conclusions applicable to most other regions. The history of cattle ranching in the savanna of the western state of Mato Grosso do Sul is traced below. Today, this state is one of the most dynamic beef cattle ranching regions of Brazil, supporting closed to twenty million head in an area of 350,000 square kilometers. Such development followed a timeline similar to that of the American West, a product of ranching expansion from the 1870s onward, particularly during and after World War I (similarities with U.S. ranching end there, however). Before discussing the historical process, it is important to examine the cerrado region as an ecological unit.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jamie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: time period",,

The expansion of extensive cattle ranching and mechanised agriculture have been major driving forces in this transformation process. In the Midwest, one of the last frontier regions in Brazil, extensive savanna land has recently been cleared for cash-crop production and pastureland. After the displacement of indigenous people during early confrontations with Portuguese explorers in the eighteenth century, we are now witnessing the dispossession of traditional small-scale farmers who had settled in the region two centuries ago. Rural communities have remained marginalised and powerless in the face of pressure and impact from recent development of agribusiness and cattle ranching. The agricultural activity of the smallholders is subsistence-oriented with little market integration, and their production system (shifting cultivation) is based on local knowledge, which seems to be well adapted to the savanna environment. The system is no longer sustainable. Due to capitalist expansion and prevailing conditions of unsecured land tenure, lack of access to basic assets, and high population pressure on scarce resources, the peasants have had a intensify production.

As major crops such as soy continue to experience growing market demand and threaten both natural ecosystems and traditional populations, a number of multi-stakeholder governance initiatives have been established around agricultural commodity chains or key landscapes. Effectiveness in curbing unsustainable land use, however, remains limited. In this context, innovative initiatives have blurred the lines to combine both supply chain and landscape governance. We analyze such arrangements—here conceptualized as commodity-centric landscape governance (CCLG)—with an in-depth case study of the Cerrado Working Group, a multi-stakeholder initiative led by civil society and the soy agribusiness to address land use change in that savanna landscape in Brazil. The paper examines how that initiative has come about, its agenda, as well as usually underexposed political dimensions using agenda-setting theory. The research is based on extensive fieldwork in Brazil, with data collected through document analysis and 56 key-informant interviews. The findings suggest that a sustainable development agenda for the Cerrado has been substantially narrowed to become mostly one of conversion-free soy supply, serving more the interests of that agroindustry and its consumers than those of the landscape's most vulnerable stakeholders, such as local communities. While the Cerrado Working Group has importantly broadened the policy scope beyond commodity certification, its limited inclusiveness and a skewed agenda have led to instruments that target only soy farmers as beneficiaries. We conclude that, although effective for targeting conversion drivers, CCLG can crystallize and reinforce existing land use patterns by granting disproportionate power to dominant stakeholders, thus limiting the agenda to incremental changes. As a consequence, distant demand-side actors may exert greater governance authority than the landscape's own population. If embodying norms of inclusiveness and equitable participation, CCLG may serve as an entry point, but it does not per se replace inclusive land-use planning and integrated landscape governance. © Copyright © 2020 Bastos Lima and Persson.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jamie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: brazil,cerrado",,

Vast areas of Amazon rainforest and savannah vegetation were converted there, since the 1970s, into places of intensive soybean farming, basically to fulfil exogenous demands for land and agriculture production. The present assessment goes beyond the configuration of new places at the agricultural frontier, and starts with a qualitative intellectual jump: from place-making on the frontier to place-making as an ontological frontier in itself. It means that, instead of merely studying the frontier as a constellation of interconnected places, we examine the politicised genesis of the emerging places and their trajectory under fierce socio-ecological disputes. The consideration of almost five decades of intense historic-geographical change reveals an intriguing dialectics of displacement (of previous socio-ecological systems, particularly affecting squatters and indigenous groups, in order to create opportunities for migrants and companies), replacement (of the majority of disadvantaged farmers and poor migrants, leading to land concentration, widespread financialisation and the decisive influence of transnational corporations) and misplacement (which is the synthesis of displacement and replacement, demonstrated by mounting risks and a pervasive sentiment of maelstrom). Overall, there was nothing inevitable in the process of rural and regional development, but the problems, conflicts and injustices that characterise its turbulent geographical trajectory were all more or less visible from the outset. © 2016, The Author(s).","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jamie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: brazil,demography,mato grosso",,

International certifications in tropical fruits such as GlobalGAP, Rainforest Alliance, organic or fair-trade, have various limitations: (1) they acknowledge these emerging issues only partially; (2) the standards are uniform and do not take into account the heterogeneity of contexts and of opportunities to build up more sustainable supply chains; (3) these certifications are focused on the farm, the product or the producer organization, but not on the territory, the watershed, the agro-ecosystem and the wider context of local and regional institutional settings. To address these limitations, Agrofair and the TASTE Foundation conducted in-depth case studies of organic and fair-trade certified production systems, in their territorial settings in Peru and Ecuador. North Peru is an arid zone which heavily depends on irrigation, with smallholders who cultivate banana plots of 1 ha in monoculture systems. In South Ecuador, a semi-humid zone was studied, with medium sized producers (5-10 ha) and agroforestry systems (cocoa-forest-banana) in the hillsides. In a second dimension of the study, a rapid survey among five supermarkets in The Netherlands and Belgium and one procurement organization was carried out, to assess the feasibility to introduce a banana with a kind of denomination of origin: mountain-grown banana (Ecuador) or savannah-grown banana (Peru). Could these denominations be carriers of specific sustainability messages (on top of the organic and fair-trade labels)? The survey learned that the retail sector is not looking for complex messages or specific branding: these bananas may have their origin in very different regions, but are all genetically identical Cavendish bananas. However, there are signs that supermarkets are receptive for a more comprehensive approach to a more sustainable banana. This would open new action perspectives for a territorial approach and promotion of a banana with added environmental value.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jamie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: peru,ecuador,farming context",,

In September 2016, the Government of Amapá presented a zoning proposal (Zoneamento Socioambiental do Cerrado [ZSC]) that reserves most of the savannas for agricultural activities. Here, we outline how the methodology employed is flawed because it does not include fauna surveys, evaluations of ecosystem services or an assessment of the social importance of the savannas. The ZSC authors admit that, contrary to Brazilian legislation, the zoning was carried out with the single intention of increasing agriculture production. Current knowledge indicates that Amapá’s savannas are rich in biodiversity, including endemic and threatened species, and are also home to a rich culture of traditional populations. These savannas are important providers of ecosystem services that, if intact, could represent around US$ 1.52 billion annually. We hold that the ZSC should be reformulated, with fair participation of stakeholders, in accordance with Brazil’s legal requirements. At least 30% of the savannas should be protected, local family farming should be supported, and the rights of traditional peoples must now be assured through recognition of their land rights. © The Author(s) 2017.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jamie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: brazil",,

The 'environmental stratification' approach, based essentially on pedological, geomorphological and vegetational studies was used, providing a rapid assessment of the ecogeography, its long-term possibilities and constraints. The integrated land use assessment of the stratified units was discussed. Among the four units, three main units occur on the extensive plain surface, forming a climatic gradient. The Caracarai-Anaua unit is dominated by forest and campina vegetation, associated with latosols and hydromorphic podzols. The Lavrado unit is dominated by open grass savanna, with fire-resistant species and gallery forest featuring Buriti palms, resembling a 'dambo'-like landscape. In most cases, the boundaries between these two units are abrupt forest/savanna contacts. The Surumu unit is characterized by xerophytic savanna with cactus, with semiarid species and sodic soils occurring on volcanic-acid rocks. Overall, the present tendency is for an invasion of forest vegetation into savanna areas. The process is directly related to the evolution of the 'veredas de buritis' ecosystem and the capture of closed lakes and 'dambo'-like swamps as 'veredas de buritis' extend and landscape rejuvenation occurs. The main agronomic constraint is the very low nutrient status of the soils, allied to the high aluminum saturation in the Caracarai-Anaua and Lavrado units, and the high sodium content, erosion hazard and stony soils in the Surumu unit. The carrying capacity and the resilience against changes of the units are generally very low. In spite of that, the overall extent of land colonization in Roraima increased by about 70% from 1980 to 1985, although small settlements increased by a disproportionate 242% over that period, mainly as a result of colonization in the forested Caracarai-Anaua unit; in contrast, there was an absolute reduction of 23% in the number of very large settlements. The official land colonization policy was discussed, illustrating the human scenario in NE Roraima. The absence of strategies for rural development is evident, and the current pattern of high mobility of these 'colonos' (settlers) associated with seasonal burning and gold-mining are direct consequences of this illconceived policy. The discredited strategy of cattle ranching is dominant, but no long-term regional planning for development exists. The pattern of human occupation in NE Roraima accords with the pattern of land use in other parts of Amazonia, and highlights the difficulties facing policies seeking to intensify the use of forest land and to achieve effective land colonization. Powerful ecological constraints at the smallholder level prevent sustained farming and development. It is likely that, given these considerable social and ecological constraints, the development model pursued in Roraima today will not provide an economic solution for sustaining the livelihood of most of its inhabitants, perpetuating the present social inequality in any foreseeable scenario.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jamie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: brazil",,

This paper assesses the potential impacts of bioenergy production from local varieties of castor oil plant and jatropha that could reduce the import of energy in the region, while developing its economy. Biodiesel systems based on these crops can be suitable for the Northeast region as they have low water needs, and are either indigenous or have shown excellent adaptation to the local climate. Apart from biodiesel production, the residue from their processing can be a valuable resource usable for biogas production and bio-fertilizers. Using the ecosystem services approach, five land management alternatives are compared: (i) Caatinga woodland (a type of dry savannah native to the region), (ii) a scheme of local jatropha varieties and vegetation for Caatinga forest restoration, (iii) a crop rotation scheme of castor oil plant and cowpeas, (iv) cowpea mono-cropping, and (v) pasture. Based on the analysis of secondary data, some provisioning and regulating services were assessed quantitatively, while others qualitatively. The results suggest that the conversion of (i) cowpea mono-cropping to a rotation of cowpeas and castor and (ii) degraded pastures to a jatropha-Caatinga forest restoration scheme can provide a bundle of provisioning, regulating and supporting ecosystem services. Feedstock for bioenergy is the most important ecosystem service derived from these multi-functional landscapes. In particular converting pasture to a jatropha-Caatinga forest restoration scheme could provide per hectare 0.7 t of oilseeds for biodiesel production and 1.8 GJ of usable energy, in the form of biogas from the residual seedcake. The castor-cowpea rotation scheme could provide per hectare 1.5 t of oilseeds for biodiesel production together with 2.2 GJ of usable biogas energy, per hectare. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jamie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: brazil,caatinga,socioeconomic",,

Conservation initiatives should therefore address the drivers of hunting, rather than its practice alone. Here we gathered information from structured interviews with 68 local households to assess the drivers of hunting in a highly threatened Amazonian savannah complex, the Cerrado of Amapá in Brazil. We used regression models to evaluate the influence of socio-economic parameters and spatial variables on hunting prevalence and frequency. The only identified driver of hunting prevalence was forest cover, whereas five variables had significant effects on hunting frequency. The positive effect of forest cover and the negative effect of hunter's age on hunting frequency suggest that logistical and physical feasibility are important drivers of hunting frequency. Furthermore, we suggest that the negative effect of distance to urban centres may be related to the profitability of hunting. We base this on the negative effect of river length in the vicinity of households and per capita monthly income on hunting frequency, which corroborates the tendency of hunting frequency to decrease when alternatives to wild meat are more readily available. We argue that to reduce unsustainable hunting it is necessary both to raise awareness amongst local communities and involve them in the creation of management plans that conserve biodiversity and meet economic and social needs.

This article demonstrates how such a dualistic structure shapes Brazil's technical cooperation with Mozambique, pointing out that it is still unclear how far rural development perspectives rooted in the particularities of Brazilian agrarian dynamics would be useful for projects implemented in different rural contexts. We argue that, since Mozambican agricultural plans primarily emphasize a perspective that focuses on market-oriented agricultural modernization, a potential reform of the current cooperation policy toward more inclusive agenda, focused on family farming, faces political economy constraints.

It also explores the theoretical dimensions surrounding the debate over the relative importance of socioeconomic and environmental variables in explaining land change. Results from the land change analysis show several hotspots of dynamic change. The majority of woody vegetation loss occurred in the eastern lowlands of Santa Cruz, Beni, and Pando and was attributable to the expansion of industrial agriculture. Gains in woody vegetation took place in the drylands of Santa Cruz and Beni savanna, and these changes were attributed to shifting patterns in precipitation and fire rather than human-induced change. Other hotspots of woody vegetation gain were attributed to abandonment of agriculture and herbaceous lands in the intermontane valleys of the southern Andes. Regression analyses showed that population and other demographic variables were poor predictors of land change. There is a clear relationship, however, between changes in woody and agriculture/herbaceous vegetation and environmental variables such as precipitation, temperature, and elevation.

These landscape transformations have global drivers, but they are often justified by a dominant rationale that they bring development to otherwise underprivileged regions. Such development claims, however, are either taken at face value or conflated with simplistic macroeconomic indicators that gloss over most social issues. Those claims may, therefore, hide severe inequities. To better analyze these phenomena, we revisit and conceptualize the notion of maldevelopment, here defined as inequitable and exclusive processes of change that deprive most local stakeholders of their social and material capabilities. Using an inclusiveness framework, we then conduct an in-depth analysis of soy expansion in the Matopiba region of Brazil's Cerrado. This rich biome with a mosaic of land uses forms an agriculture-savanna landscape that is rapidly giving way to soy monoculture – under the guise of development. Through fieldwork and primary data collection in 18 Matopiba municipalities, we have interviewed 62 stakeholders in that landscape transformation from different social groups. We assess how soy expansion has altered access and allocation patterns of key resources such as land and water, as well as participation in the local food systems and governance initiatives. When looking beyond general economic indicators, our findings expose a brutally exclusive process of environmental degradation and resource dispossession. Yet the stakeholders we interviewed do not want to simply be left undisturbed but to experience inclusive development instead, with participation in governance and support for bottom-up initiatives. We conclude that the frequently cited claim that industrial monocultures bring development to underserved regions deserves far greater scrutiny, and that inclusiveness in the design and execution of interventions is crucial for avoiding maldevelopment. © 2020 The Author(s)","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jamie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: brazil,cerrado",,

Conceptual modelling enables assessment of how anthropogenic drivers (e.g. land use/land cover change and climate change) modify natural processes, being a useful tool to support strategic decision-making. The present work describes a conceptual model to evaluate water-related ecosystem service provision under different land use scenarios in the Matopiba region of the Brazilian Cerrado, the world’s most biodiverse savanna and an agricultural frontier. Model variables were determined (direct drivers, indirect drivers, focal components and responses) and the Nature Futures Framework was consulted to incorporate socio-ecological components and feedbacks. Future scenarios were developed considering potential trajectories of drivers and governance responses that may impact land use in the region, including the possibility of full compliance with Forest Code and implementation of the Soy Moratorium in the region. The conceptual model and scenarios developed in the present study may be useful to improve understanding of the complex interactions among anthropogenic drivers, water-related ecosystem services and their potential repercussions for natural and social systems of the region. Governance decisions will be critical to maintaining the ecosystems of the region, the services it provides and the culture and tradition of the people historically embedded in the landscape. In acknowledgment of humanity’s dependence on nature, the importance of inverting the way scenarios are used is highlighted. Rather than using scenarios to measure the impacts of different policy options on nature, scenarios representing the desired outcomes for biodiversity and ecosystem services can be used to inform how policies can guarantee ecosystem integrity into the future. © 2020, Universidade Estadual de Campinas UNICAMP.

We tested whether personal variables (gender, age and years of formal education), and farm characteristics (type and size) were determinant in their perceptions. We interviewed 75 landowners in the Brazilian savanna region, using a questionnaire and paired images strategy (e.g., pictures of soybean cultivation with and without native forest vegetation). Our analyses revealed that landowners perceive native areas as providing ESs. Gender, age and size of farm did not affect the landowners’ perceptions of ESs. However, we observed that years of formal education increased the chance of perceiving ESs which are more difficult to observe (pollination and pest regulation). Those services may require more scientific background to be understood.

This has led the country to develop new policies and implement a biodiesel program (PNPB) in 2004 aiming at fostering the rural development and at the same time promoting a new and clean source of energy. Nevertheless, there is an ongoing international debate about the negative impacts of bioenergy, especially biofuels, such as, the consequences to native forests and on local food production. In this context, the present study aims to assess the relationship between small-scale oil seed activity and food production, as well as, with the deforestation of native forests. A cross-sectional study was conducted with small-scale farmers in the Brazilian savannah, in a transitional region between the Cerrado and the Amazon rain forest. A range of socio-economic and environmental indicators were collected among smallholders who cultivate Jatropha curcas and Ricinus communis and from them different scenarios were established, which estimated the impacts on climate change and on local food production due to oil seed activity. The results point towards a positive relationship between oil seed production and deforestation and a negative relationship between oil seed activity and local food production. The latter result, therefore, exacerbates local food insecurity. The research is unprecedented in the region and the results can be extremely effective in supporting regional and national government subsidies on clean energy that do not harm the local environment or food production; helping Brazil achieve regional sustainable development. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jamie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: brazil",,

III-Direct seeding, an organic soil management technique. Since the 1980s, Brazilian agriculture has extended to the humid tropical edge of the Amazon basin in western Brazil and onto the acid soils of the savanna (cerrados) where annual rainfall ranges from 2 000 to 3 000 mm. Frontier farmers, coming from the southern states, have introduced soybean monocultures and disc tillage techniques to develop highly mechanised farms of 200-2 000 ha. These farming practices have caused soil erosion on a catastrophic scale. Since 1986, the Franco-Brazilian research team and its development partners have demonstrated the extent of cropland degradation and the economic isolation of these areas. A participatory method of agricultural development, known as innovation-extension, has been developed in the western cerrados and a number of other regions of Brazil. The aim of innovation-extension is to propose cropping systems to farmers and professional agents in agricultural subsectors that are compatible with sustainable regional development and which can be reproduced inexpensively on a large scale. This experience has revealed that fertility management for degraded acid soil cannot be separated from economic risk, which has led to the development of a wide range of diversified agricultural systems now spread over more than 2 Mha of land in western and central western Brazil. Crop diversification is based on the productionof one or two cereal or forage crops per year (soybean, rainfed rice, maize, sorghum, millet, leguminous crops, forage grasses, cover crops, etc.), which may be associated with livestock production. Annual crop sequences are integrated into 3 or 4 year rotations. The most productive and innovative systems all use direct seeding: the main commercial crops - soybean, rainfed rice, maize - are sown directly into a well-established and inexpensive cover crop such as millet, sorghum or crotalaria, which precedes and succeeds the main cash crop. These cover crops produce cereals or fodder and a large amount of biomass which is necessary for maintaining fertility. In this way there is permanent plant cover to protect the soil from erosion. Cover crops are important in recycling nutrients that have been leached deep into the soil and thus there is minimum nutrient loss in the soil-plant system. Yields of more than 6 t of maize, 3-4 t of soybean and more than 4 t of rainfed rice per hectare have been attained. Farmers regard these systems as productive, profitable, stable and consider that they optimise and offer flexibility for the use of machinery.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jamie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: brazil,farming context",,

The wetlands occupy topographic depressions on the flat plateau, which are permanently or seasonally waterlogged, with topsoil that has high contents of organic matter and endemic fauna and flora. These systems are important for regulating the water flux in the riverine network. Despite their environmental importance, the wetlands are largely neglected in planning policy, environmental legislation and scientific research, resulting in their degradation by the expansion and intensification of agriculture. In the studied catchment, a typical tropical savannah landscape and a region of typical agribusiness land use in the state of Minas Gerais was considered, where the Vereda and Murundu ecosystems are completely surrounded by agriculture. The transition zone between dry and wet soils is the most fragile and susceptible to degradation because it is subjected to the continuous expansion of land tillage. If the agribusiness model deployed in the region is responsible for the increase in wetland destruction, then changes in regulatory laws to define and preserve permanent preservation areas in the Brazilian Forest Code, for the years 1934, 1965, 1989 and in the two versions from 2012, are an impediment to the effectiveness of forest and wetlands protection and the policy of sustainable development. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jamie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: brazil,cerrado",,

The savanna biome is responsible for 86% of all fire events, contributes to 10% of the total carbon emissions annually and is home to 10% of the human population. European colonization has been associated with the implementation of fire suppression policies in many tropical savanna regions, markedly disrupting traditional fire management practices and transforming ecosystems. In this paper we assess savanna burning approaches from pre-colonial to contemporary eras in three regions: northern Australia, southern Africa and Brazil. In these regions, fire suppression policies have led to (i) conflicts between government authorities and local communities; (ii) frequent late dry season wildfires and/or (iii) woody encroachment. Such consequences are facilitating changes to fire management policies, including recognition and incorporation of traditional ecological knowledge in contemporary community-based adaptive savanna fire management. Such programs include implementation of prescribed early dry season fires and, in some regions, generating income opportunities for rural and traditional communities through the reduction of late dry season wildfires and associated greenhouse gas emissions. We present a brief history of fire management policies in these three important savanna regions, and identify ongoing challenges for implementation of culturally and ecologically sustainable fire management policies. © 2018","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jamie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: brazil,context,Australia,South Africa",,

Grassy ecosystems characterize extensive areas in all biomes in Brazil, offering great contribution to biological diversity and providing ecosystem services on which society depends. Palaeoecological evidence indicates these ecosystems evolved under the influence of grazing and fire, and these disturbances have been essential for controlling the dominance of woody vegetation. While the need for fire to maintain grassy biomes has been recently discussed, grazing as a management tool for conservation is still little accepted by the local scientific community and by decision-makers. Here we provide a comprehensive analysis of the current literature on grazing management and its effects on grassy ecosystems in Brazil. Based on a review of the role of grazers prior and after European colonization, and a synthesis on grazing effects across different systems, we call for the evaluation of grazing as a management tool for biodiversity conservation in Brazil's grassy systems. Grazing should be an interesting management strategy especially in Legal Reserves with grassy vegetation types, as it can ally conservation with livestock production. To achieve these potentially complementary objectives, a research agenda needs to be developed to devise adaptive management strategies for Legal Reserves. In this, relevant stakeholders should be included and both the ecological conditions of the ecosystem in question and the socioeconomic determinants considered. © 2021 Associação Brasileira de Ciência Ecológica e Conservação","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jamie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: brazil",,

From the 1960's, the Cerrado has been occupied by migrants from southern Brazil who have converted the native vegetation (mostly woody savannas) into extensive pastures and monocrops. From coffee and cotton in the initial Cerrado's agricultural occupation to soybean, corn, cattle and swine nowadays, the landscape suffered a huge transformation and several liabilities related to ecosystem services loss are emerging. Säo Gabriel do Oeste is a typical agricultural municipality of the Cerrado and, therefore, can be considered as representative of the current agricultural model. Along with climate change impacts of the conventional agriculture through greenhouse gas emissions, soil loss is worrying because it is not truly renewable if incorrectly managed. The emergy assessment of the agricultural system, including soil loss as a nonrenewable flow, was compared to the assessment including soil loss as a negative externality to better understand its impact on the emergy indicators. Soil loss and GHG emissions accounts for 95% of the total externalities and soil loss alone, for 46%. Moreover, different levels of soil loss were accounted for to infer its impact on the productive and economic systems. In addition, to conclude the assessment, the native forest area to compensate the dependence of the system on economy resources was calculated. The additional native vegetation area reaches 61% of the municipality area and the cost to the native forestry recovery is estimated in 1,039 EM$.ha-1year-1. The results here presented can be useful for new agricultural public policies related to the ecosystem services compensation and payment mechanisms taking into account the extent and magnitude of ecosystem services loss. © 2016 L&H Scientific Publishing, LLC.

Growing market demand for commodities, states’ interest in expanding their fiscally fertile territories, and environmental conservation pressures have promoted resource frontiers, where locals all too frequently lose access to land, water and livelihoods. To add momentum and legitimize outsiders’ agendas, such locations are sometimes framed as “last frontiers” – the final places of possibility. While various forms of resource “grabbing” have gained increased attention, we argue that a crucial dimension of frontier dynamics – neglect and its role in facilitating dispossession – warrants further study as it tends to be overlooked. Drawing on the frontiers and political ecology literature, this article analyzes how neglect by state authorities, markets, and environmental organizations paves the way for dispossession in those landscapes. We compare two cases: the Matopiba soy frontier in the savannas of Brazil's Cerrado and the Chin Hills of western Myanmar. Our results show how neglect is critical to imaginatively frame regions as “empty” places of possibility, excluding local actors economically from development and politically from governance initiatives. We argue that neglect not only precedes but is an enduring feature of resource frontiers, and identify four consecutive phases: (I) pre-frontier abandonment, (II) selective support to outsiders, (III) overlooked harms to communities, and (IV) socially exclusive sustainability agendas. As environmental concerns gain increasing global salience, Phase I sometimes leaps to Phase IV as international actors pounce to control what they regard as “last frontiers” for conservation. We conclude that external actors’ inaction enables local communities’ dispossession as much as their actions. This raises critical policy and scholarly questions about actors' responsibility and accountability, not only for harms done but also for systematically failing to heed local actors’ aspirations and needs. © 2021 The Author(s)","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jamie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: brazil",,

Since hydropower depends on water availability, it is particularly vulnerable to drought events, making the Brazilian electricity matrix vulnerable to climate change. Starting in 2005, Brazil opened the matrix to new renewable sources, including sugarcane-based electricity. Sugarcane is known for its resilience to short dry spells. Over the last decades, its production area moved from the coastal plains of the Atlantic Forest biome to the savannahs of the Cerrado biome, which is characterised by a five-to six month-long dry season. The sugarcane-based electricity system is highly dynamic and complex due to the interlinkages, dependencies, and cascading impacts between its agricultural and industrial subsystems. This paper applies the risk framework proposed by the IPCC to assess climate-change-driven drought risks to sugarcane electricity generation systems to identify their strengths and weaknesses, considering the system dynamics and linkages. Our methodology aims to understand and characterize drought in the agriculture as well as industrial subsystems and offers a specific understanding of the system by using indicators tailored to sugarcane-based electricity generation. Our results underline the relevance of actions at different levels of management. Initiatives, such as regional weather forecasts specifically for agriculture, and measures to increase industrial water-use efficiency were identified to be essential to reduce the drought risk. Actions from farmers and mill owners, supported and guided by the government at different levels, have the potential to increase the resilience of the system. For example, the implementation of small dams was identified by local actors as a promising intervention to adapt to the long dry seasons; however, they need to be implemented based on a proper technical assessment in order to locate these dams in suitable places. Moreover, the results show that creating and maintaining small water reservoirs to enable the adoption of deficit-controlled irrigation technology contribute to reducing the overall drought risk of the sugarcane-based electricity generation system. © 2022 by the authors.

However, it often remains difficult to fully capture the factors underlying differences in perceptions of usefulness. A quantitative ethnobotanical study was conducted in Indigenous Territory and National Park Isiboro-Sécure (TIPNIS), Bolivia, to compare the plant use knowledge and management of the Yuracarés and Trinitarios, two indigenous groups that share the same living environment. Results show that the Trinitarios have higher knowledge of plants from anthropogenic environments and maintain a significantly larger pharmacopoeia than the Yuracarés. By contrast, the Yuracarés are more knowledgeable of wild flora and particularly excel in their knowledge of wild food plants. I relate these differences to: (1) cultural heritage, customs and practices; (2) ethnomedicinal system; (3) (historical) mode of subsistence; (4) provenance; (5) history of contact with Western society; and (6) modernization and social position.

This region is suitable for growing diverse crops ranging from staple crops and livestock to high-valued commodities such as cacay (a nut whose oil is used in the cosmetic industry). OBJECTIVE: The model suggested an optimal portfolio of agricultural enterprises for a representative farm that maximizes revenues net of variable costs and returns to resource endowments. Traditional agricultural enterprises were assessed, as well as some others that appear to be promising possibilities for Altillanura. METHODS: A linear programming model (LP) was designed to support the assessment of the relative profitability of agricultural enterprises in a post-conflict era as a response for the need to reduce agricultural net imports, satisfy a growing domestic food demand and boost economic and social development. RESULTS and CONCLUSION: A major finding was that labor shortages in the region are a key constraint for perennial crops such as oil palm, cacay, and cashew. Inclusion of mechanized crops like rice, corn, and soybean can help to alleviate this limitation, resulting in the preferred farm choice among the conventional farm activities. Integrated (Crop + Hog) operation is the most profitable among promising enterprises, but its operation size would be constrained by access to processing plants and marketing strategies. Cacay and cashew represent a viable option for farms to increase net returns using high-valued perennial crops. SIGNIFICANCE: Currently, cattle production on native savannas is the most common agricultural activity in the region, but this model challenged this status quo by identifying other more profitable alternatives that include improved production systems for cattle, hogs, and crops. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jamie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: colombia,socioeconomic",,

The Llanos have traditionally supported extensive beef cattle production systems but are increasingly in demand for food, feed and oil production. The establishment of improved tropical pastures is a continuing trend as a means of intensifying beef production. Published data and the authors' own on-farm databases were collated and analyzed to estimate commercial cattle weight gains. A total of 198 records representing pastures directly drilled into native savanna and pastures undersown with rain-fed upland rice and maize were available for the 1979-2016 period, and were compared with savanna-based beef production. Records were available for sown paddocks 1-15 years in age that were managed solely by ranchers or by consensus between ranchers and researchers. Performance was not affected by who made the management decisions. Pastures sown in association with maize largely out-yielded all others, but observations on these paddocks were restricted to only 3 years and there was a steep fall in production with age. Differences between conventionally established and riceassociated pastures decreased rapidly over time, and production from these pastures did not differ over the longer term. Pasture age and stocking rate during the rainy season were the major factors influencing output from all systems. Overall, adjusted, long-term weight gains per year ranged between 11 and 386 kg/ha for savanna and maize undersown pastures. The data suggest a need to document long-term planned, regular, crop-pasture rotations, but none was available. The analyses provide valuable, long-term estimates of realized beef production under commercial conditions that should assist in decision-making by graziers and policy makers. © 2019.Los Llanos Orientales de Colombia se caracterizan por sabanas tropicales formadas sobre suelos ácidos, pobres en nutrientes, pero constituyen un recurso de tierras muy importante para el país.

In both areas, 60 (10 × 10 m) nested-plots were established in a representative portion of the forest. All woody plants were identified, and their common and scientific names and uses were recorded. The ethnobotanical study was conducted by open-interviews initially and ranking at a later stage for a total of two years of study. The Xavante people use more species, 56% of the 57 species fit in five categories of direct use while the settlers have direct use for 50% of the 44 species found in the forest. The Xavante culture has strong links with the native biodiversity, valuing the multiple use of the species while the settlers use them mostly for timber. The species with higher IVI in the phytosociological study were also the most valued in both communities. Brosimum wood is used for the making of traditional clubs by the Xavante, the fruits are edible and attract wildlife for hunting. The non-Xavante people have been heavily logging these trees for fence posts used in the large farms of the region.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jamie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: brazil,indigenous,mato grosso,farming context",,

In 2004, some debates led the country to develop new policies and implement the National Biodiesel Use and Production Program (PNPB), with the intent to increase the share of renewable energy and foster rural development. In this context, the present study aims to assess the linkages between family farmers living standard and the adoption of oil seed activity in the Tocantins State, in a region of transition between the Cerrado (Brazilian savannah) and the Amazon rain forest. Ranges of socio-economic indicators were collected among smallholders who cultivate Jatropha curcas and Ricinus communis. A factor analysis based on living standard criteria and a non-linear probit model were applied to assess the inclusion of poor rural families in the biodiesel chain. Preliminary results point towards a positive relation between the family degree of deprivation and adoption of oil seed activity, for the Ricinus communis production, and a negative relation, for the Jatropha curcas production.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jamie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: brazil,cerrado",,

We draw on microdata from Brazil's agricultural censuses, aggregated into five farm size classes at the municipality level. While TFP growth has been high on the largest farms, it has been slightly higher on the smallest farms. And when attention is restricted to the 9.5 per cent of farms that accounted for 86 per cent of total production value – those that we designate as ‘large scale’ – it is clear that most were small and medium-sized farms located in the South and Southeast.

A 12-year cash flow was built with both experimental data and estimates for three IFS in the Savannah region: ICL (crops + cattle); ICLF1 (ICL + 227 eucalyptus trees/ha); and ICLF2 (ICL + 357 eucalyptus trees/ha). Investment analysis showed all IFS were viable, but ICL was more profitable than ICLF, due to occasional high crops and beef prices and low wood prices in 2016. In extreme scenarios, i.e. all commodities prices were high (SCE I) or all low (SCE II), results remained the same. However, an alternative, most likely, scenario (SCE III) showed ICLF were more economically recommended than ICL, as beef and crop prices dropped and wood prices increased, which is expected because of commodities price volatility. Thus, the introduction of forestry in future IFS is economically viable, although market risks remain.

Frontier farmers, coming from the southern states, have introduced soybean monocultures and disc tillage techniques to develop highly mechanised farms of 200-2 000 ha. These farming practices have caused soil erosion on a catastrophic scale. Since 1986, the Franco-Brazilian research team and its development partners have demonstrated the extent of crop land degradation and the economic isolaton of these areas. A participatory method of agricultural development, known as generation plus extension, has been developed in the western cerrados and a number of other regions of Brazil. The aim of development-extension is to propose cropping systems to farmers and professional agents in agricultural subsections that are compatible with sustainable regional development and which can be reproduced inexpensively on a large scale. This experience has revealed that management of fertility of degraded acid soil cannot be separated from economic risk, which has led to the development of a wide range of diversified agricultural systems now spread over more than 2 Mha of land in western and central western Brazil. The most productive and innovative systems all use direct drilling; the main commerical crops - soybean, rainfed rice, mazie - are sown directly into a well-established and inexpensive cover crop such as millet, sorghum or crotalaria, which precedes and succeeds the main cash crop. These cover crops produce cereals or fodder and a large amount of biomass which is necessary for maintaining fertility. In this way there is permanent plant cover to protect the soil from erosion. Cover crops are important in recycling nutrients that have been leached deep into the soil and thus there is minimum nutrient loss in the soil-plant system. Farmers regard these systems as productive, profitable, stable and consider that they optimise and offer flexiability for the use of machinery. There are three papers which comprise. This issue; they cover the agricultural generation plus extension method; fertility management using cropping systems; and direct drilling as an organic method of soil management.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jamie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: brazil,cerrado,actor focus,farming context",,

The coffee culture was predominant in Brazil during the first half of the century. This crop greatly influenced the country's national and international economic standing. That period was called the Brazilian coffee cycle, most notably in the south and southeast, where pedoclimatic and geomorphological conditions were more appropriate. However, during the second half of the century, soy and cattle-raising became major factors influencing the expansion of Brazilian agriculture and the incorporation of new areas to the territory, specifically in the savanna region. This expansion was the result of prevailing morphopedological conditions and the new technologies brought about by advances in agronomic research linked to soil correction, fertilization, and irrigation. Subsequent hydropedological imbalances have accelerated erosive water dissection of the relief and the consequent production of sediments, responsible for silting valley floors, reservoirs, and drainage channels. These problems are frequently caused or promoted by the intense and indiscriminate deforestation taking place, in the case of coffee, on large expanses of the Mata Atlântica (Atlantic Forest), and in the case of soy, in the savanna. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We also examined the impact of harvest on population structure, number of leafs and length of unexpanded leafs, both in harvested and unharvested populations. In Plato, unexpanded leaves are harvested only from sub-adults and adults, which does not appear to affect individual palms or the palm population. In Magangué, palms are harvested from the size-class juveniles, thus limiting their growth; this results in populations with very few adults, compromising sustainability, even in short term. The model of community use and free access to the palms, has allowed their preservation in Plato, contrary to what happened in Magangué, where individual appropriation was made, both legally and illegally, causing population fragmentation, logging and restriction of access for harvesters. Future management in Plato should focus on halting logging and minimizing impact on the wetland complex, where the palms grow.

Burned communities exhibited more C4 grass cover, higher proportion of resprouts and lower canopy cover as compared to the old-growth forest. Moreover, 79% of woody species at the burned sites are generalists with a widespread distribution, which includes the cerrado (Brazilian savanna).

Pastures sown on flat lands had younger modal ages (three years) and were renovated more frequently than those sown on hilly or dissected savannahs (10 years). These differences were probably a result of variations in infrastructure and relative stage of development of the two topographies, but slight differences in inherent soil fertility may also have played a role.

From an environmental point of view, eucalyptus monocultures fragment the areas hitherto preserved of the Cerrado (savannah) biome, leading to loss of connectivity and hampering reproduction of plants and animals. The removal of native vegetation reduces the reproductive capacity of fauna, which in turn, interferes with the resilience capacity of savannah vegetation areas still preserved. In socio-economic terms, the afforestation contributes to the concentration of income and boosts the rural exodus and uncontrolled urbanization process. While afforestation projects can be seen, individually, as economically viable activities, systemically they can result in significant externalities, especially when conducted on large scale, with environmental and social losses that sooner or later will lead to economic unsustainability.

Aguiar A.",,,,,"The unsustainable use of the soil of the deforested area at the Amazonian border is one of the greatest threats to the rainforest, because it is the predominant cause of shifting cultivation in the region. The sustainable management of soils with low natural fertility is a major challenge for smallholder agriculture in the humid tropics. In the periphery of Brazilian Amazonia, agricultural practices that are recommended for the Brazilian savannah, such as saturating soils with soluble nutrients do not ensure the sustainability of agroecosystems. Improvements in the tilled topsoil cannot be maintained if deterioration of the porous soil structure is not prevented and nutrient losses in the root zone are not curtailed. The information gleaned from experiments affirms that in the management of humid tropical agrosystems, the processes resulting from the interaction between climatic factors and indicators of soil quality must be taken into consideration. It must be remembered that these interactions manifest themselves in ways that cannot be predicted from the paradigm established in the other region like the southeast of Brazil, which is based only on improving the chemical indicators of soil quality. The physical indicators play important role in the sustainable management of the agrosystems of the region and for these reasons must be considered. Therefore, alley cropping is a potential substitute for slash and burn agriculture in the humid tropics with both environmental and agronomic advantages, due to its ability to produce a large amount of residues on the soil surface and its effect on the increase of economic crop productivity in the long term.

Studies about this approach have shown that managed plant populations have the most interesting features for use by human populations because they have more productive plants and larger fruits. To evaluate this effect, the traditional management of Caryocar coriaceum Wittm (pequi) in the Chapada do Araripe region of Northeast Brazil was studied by using a morphometric and ethnobotanical approach. A morphometric analysis of the fruits was conducted, during which the plants were recorded to the following three different management regimes: cultivation, in situ management (collection) and incipient management (the tolerance and protection of individuals). To test the hypothesis that people perceive natural morphological variations in the fruits, local people perception was assessed through different methods. To assess the possible influence of management regimes on fruit morphology, 40 reproductive individuals cultivated, 40 managed in situ and 36 individuals under incipient management were randomly selected, and 20 fruits of each were collected for the morphometric analyses. The fruits from individuals grown under the cultivation system were significantly different from the individuals who were managed in situ and from those under incipient management. The perception study showed that local people perceive great morphological diversity among the study populations, which was consistent with the findings of the morphometric analyses. Based on these results, it could be said that C. coriaceum is in the early stage of the domestication process. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jamie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: brazil",,
